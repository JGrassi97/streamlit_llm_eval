  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving climate patterns affect the development of wind and solar power in India over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are likely to impact the efficiency and feasibility of wind and solar energy systems in India.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate patterns in India are changing, with projected temperature increases and altered precipitation affecting renewable energy development. The average temperature is expected to rise, reaching approximately 40.12°C by 2040 in summer months, while rainfall will vary, with potential decreases and increases disrupting solar output and water availability for cooling in solar plants. Wind patterns show increases in wind speeds in certain months, presenting opportunities for enhanced wind energy efficiency. However, potential reductions in monsoon precipitation could create challenges for both solar and wind power during critical periods.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average temperatures are expected to increase significantly by 2040. | January temperature projected at 25.6°C and July at 39.12°C for 2040-2049. | Climatic dataset | numeric |\n| 2 | Variability in precipitation will impact solar energy generation. | July rainfall projected to drop to 14.36 mm and October to increase to 257.52 mm by 2040-2049. | Climatic dataset | numeric |\n| 3 | Wind speeds might slightly increase, benefiting wind energy. | July u_wind projected to be 4.39 m/s by 2040-2049. | Climatic dataset | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future projections are based on climatic models from 2020-2049.  \n- Data limitations: Historical data was not fully retrieved; projections assume consistent climatic trends.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in temperature projections but lower in precipitation variability.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Increase investment in hybrid renewable systems that combine solar and wind to mitigate risks from changing climates.  \n2. Develop adaptive infrastructure for renewable energy systems to manage variations in temperature and rainfall.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Renewable energy refers to energy generated from naturally replenished resources.  \n- The term \"u_wind\" represents horizontal wind speed, while \"v_wind\" measures vertical wind speed.",
