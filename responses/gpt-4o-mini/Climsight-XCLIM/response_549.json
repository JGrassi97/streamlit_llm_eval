  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will the health impacts of climate change differ between urban and rural populations in India by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nUrban populations are likely to experience increased heat stress, while rural communities will face agricultural disruptions due to changing precipitation patterns.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, urban areas in India like New Delhi are projected to experience significant heat stress, characterized by frequent hot spells over 35°C, which pose severe public health risks such as heat-related illnesses. In contrast, rural populations will be increasingly vulnerable to agricultural disruptions due to altered rainfall patterns, resulting in both droughts and increased variability in wet days. These changes are expected to threaten food security and livelihood stability among rural communities. Therefore, adaptation strategies should focus on strengthening urban health infrastructure and enhancing agricultural resilience in rural areas to mitigate these impacts effectively.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Urban health will be impacted more due to heat stress | Average of 8.8 hot spell days historically, projected to maintain similar levels | XCLIM AI data analysis | numeric |\n| 2 | Rural areas face agricultural disruption from changing precipitation | Consistent decrease in wet days affecting crop yields | XCLIM AI data analysis | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on climate projections from multiple models (CMIP6).  \n- Data limitations: Limited historical data on rural heat impacts; urban data is more thoroughly documented.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium confidence based on current trends and projections encompassing urban heat and rural agricultural resilience.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop urban health infrastructure to address extreme heat risks, including cooling centers and public health campaigns aimed at educating populations on heat awareness.\n2. Implement agricultural adaptation strategies for rural areas to enhance crop resilience, including investment in drought-resistant crop varieties and improved irrigation techniques.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Heat Stress**: Health issues due to prolonged exposure to high temperatures, which may lead to heat-related illnesses or fatalities, particularly among vulnerable populations.\n- **Wet Days**: Days with measurable precipitation, crucial for assessing agricultural viability affected by climate change, especially in rural settings.",
