  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will changing climate patterns affect the potential for renewable energy generation across the Iberian Peninsula by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nChanging climate patterns are likely to maintain stable conditions for renewable energy generation, particularly in wind and hydroelectric sectors, through 2040.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis indicates that precipitation patterns are stable, ensuring effective operation of hydroelectric systems, while wind speeds remain consistent, supporting wind energy generation. By 2040, projected mean maximum wind speeds will slightly increase, and precipitation intensity will show little variability, providing a favorable environment for both types of renewable energy. However, a continuous commitment to infrastructure development and adaptation to changing climate conditions is essential to maximize efficiency and resilience in energy generation.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Wind energy generation potential remains favorable. | Mean maximum wind speed projected to be 32.4 m/s by 2050. | Climate indicators report | citation |\n| 2 | Hydroelectric systems are projected to operate effectively. | Mean SDII remains stable around 5.62 mm/day by 2050. | Climate indicators report | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future projections based on climate model assessments for 2040.  \n- Data limitations: Variability might exist in extreme weather events not captured in mean projections.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium confidence due to stable historical trends, but variability in local conditions may affect projections. \n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in enhancing wind and hydroelectric infrastructure to adapt to potential fluctuations in climate.  \n2. Monitor climate conditions regularly to fine-tune energy generation strategies based on real-time data.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- SDII: Simple Daily Intensity Index measures precipitation intensity, crucial for assessing water-dependent energy systems.  \n- Wind speed metrics are essential for evaluating the feasibility of wind energy generation.",
