  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected impact of climate change on energy infrastructure resilience in coastal Louisiana, USA, over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is expected to significantly challenge energy infrastructure resilience in coastal Louisiana due to increased temperatures, extreme weather events, and flooding.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nCoastal Louisiana's energy infrastructure is increasingly vulnerable to climate change, which is expected to enhance the frequency of extreme weather events, including hurricanes and flooding. Historical trends indicate a rise in temperatures and severe weather occurrences, threatening energy reliability and safety. The combined effects of rising sea levels and adverse weather conditions could lead to substantial infrastructure damage and potential energy supply disruptions. Future resilience measures will be essential to mitigate these risks and ensure stability in the energy system amidst ongoing climate challenges.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased temperatures pose risks to energy infrastructure. | U.S. has warmed by 2.6 °F (1.4 °C) since 1970. | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_the_United_States | citation |\n| 2 | Climate change has led to more extreme weather events affecting infrastructure. | In 2024, the U.S. experienced 27 weather disasters costing over $1 billion each. | N/A | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: Limited specific data on energy infrastructure resilience specific to coastal Louisiana.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on historical trends and existing climate models.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in upgrading and reinforcing energy infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events.  \n2. Develop and implement emergency response plans to maintain energy supply during climate-related disruptions.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Energy infrastructure resilience\" refers to the ability of energy systems to withstand and recover from adverse climate impacts.  \n- \"Extreme weather events\" include hurricanes, floods, and other significant natural disasters that can disrupt energy supply.
