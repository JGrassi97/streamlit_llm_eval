  "QuestionText": "How do projected climate shifts alter the risk profile for investors in the global coffee market over the next 20 years?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow do projected climate shifts alter the risk profile for investors in the global coffee market over the next 20 years? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected climate shifts, including rising temperatures and stable precipitation, pose risks such as altered growth cycles and increased disease vulnerability for coffee investors.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next two decades, climate shifts in Pereira, Colombia, will significantly impact the global coffee market. While the increase in average temperatures—from approximately 28°C now to around 30.6°C by 2049—could result in earlier flowering and ripening of coffee cherries, it may also lead to heightened susceptibility to diseases affecting crops. Conversely, stable precipitation patterns indicate limited risks from extreme weather, which is beneficial for plant health. To mitigate risks associated with rising temperatures, investors should focus on adaptive agricultural practices and consider researching disease-resistant coffee varietals.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increasing temperatures could stress coffee cultivation. | Average temperature is projected to rise from 28.56°C to 30.61°C over 20 years. | XCLIM AI | numeric | \n| 2 | Stable precipitation patterns suggest limited cold weather impact. | No statistically significant changes in cold weather days are observed historically. | XCLIM AI | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Trends based on multi-model climate projections (CMIP6).  \n- Data limitations: Limited regional-specific studies available for Pereira.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on current climate models and historical data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop adaptive agricultural practices that enable farmers to manage increased heat and potential crop stress effectively.  \n2. Invest in research and production of disease-resistant coffee varieties to safeguard against increased pest and disease prevalence due to climate stress.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Evapotranspiration refers to the process of water evaporation from the ground and its transportation through plants to the atmosphere.  \n- CMIP6 is the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, providing climate projections to assess future climate scenarios.\n",
