  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the forecasts for the viability of renewable energy infrastructure in coastal regions of Australia given climate projections for 2040-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRenewable energy infrastructure in Sydney is projected to face increased challenges from rising temperatures and stable precipitation patterns between 2040-2050.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nThe climate projections for Sydney indicate an expected increase in the number of days exceeding 35°C, which could elevate energy demand and affect the efficiency of renewable systems. However, precipitation intensity remains stable while the number of wet days may slightly increase, suggesting heavier rainfall events that could impact energy infrastructure. The stability in maximum daily wind speeds suggests resilience in wind energy generation potential despite changing weather patterns. Overall, careful planning is necessary to address the expected challenges posed by rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased days exceeding 35°C is expected. | Projected mean of 1.52 days over 2040-2050 compared to 0.85 days historically. | Climate Indicators Analysis | numeric |\n| 2 | Stable average precipitation intensity indicates resilience. | Historical mean of 9.71 mm/day with slight changes predicted. | Climate Indicators Analysis | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections based on CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble.  \n- Data limitations: Variability in extreme weather patterns and localized impacts not fully captured.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on historical trends and model projections.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Enhance resilience of renewable energy systems against extreme temperatures and rainfall events.  \n2. Invest in ongoing monitoring and adaptive infrastructure planning for potential climate impacts.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Renewable energy infrastructure includes systems like solar panels and wind turbines used to generate power.  \n- Climate projections refer to estimations of future weather patterns based on current data trends.",
