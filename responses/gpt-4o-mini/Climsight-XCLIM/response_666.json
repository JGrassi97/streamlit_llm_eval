  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might temperature increases influence the maintenance needs of electrical grid networks in Tripoli, Libya throughout 2030-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nTemperature increases will likely lead to greater maintenance needs for electrical grid networks in Tripoli due to increased thermal stress and more frequent heat events.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected temperature increases in Tripoli (potentially exceeding 35°C for approximately 21.54 days annually by 2050) will exacerbate stress on the electrical infrastructure. This necessitates increased maintenance to adapt to thermal expansion and prevent issues such as line sagging, alongside managing the growing electricity demand during periods of extreme heat. With the mean temperature rising from approximately 293.7 K to 294.92 K, the risk of heat-induced failures within the grid heightens. Consequently, proactive planning is essential to ensure grid reliability and resilience, presenting opportunities for technology upgrades and enhanced monitoring systems.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | The mean temperature in Tripoli is projected to rise significantly. | The mean temperature adjusts to 294.92K by 2050. | Climate Analysis Report | N/A |\n| 2 | Days exceeding 35°C are increasing. | Average days: 21.54 projected for 2036-2050. | Climate Analysis Report | N/A |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections derived from CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble (ssp5-8.5).  \n- Data limitations: Limited historical reference for extreme heat effects on the electrical grid.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in projections due to model variability.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in thermal monitoring technologies to manage line stress under high temperatures.  \n2. Develop a proactive maintenance and upgrade plan for grid infrastructure to increase resilience against heat impacts.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Thermal expansion: Increase in size or volume of materials due to temperature rise.  \n- Electrical grid: Network delivering electricity from producers to consumers.
