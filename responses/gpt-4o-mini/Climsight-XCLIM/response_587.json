  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will climate risk be integrated into property insurance pricing in wildfire-prone areas of California over the next decade?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncorporation of climate risk into insurance pricing will likely increase due to heightened frequency of heat waves and evolving wildfire patterns.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nOver the next decade, the integration of climate risk into property insurance pricing in California's wildfire-prone areas will intensify. Key drivers include a significant rise in heat waves, with events projected to increase from a historical average of 0.41 annually between 1981-2020 to an anticipated 1.07 by 2036-2050. This pattern suggests compounded risks associated with increased frequency and severity of wildfires. Additionally, while the transition to wetter conditions might reduce some risks temporarily, the overall complexity of changing precipitation and temperature patterns will exert upward pressure on premiums as insurers adapt to encourage proactive risk mitigation among property owners.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heat wave events are expected to increase significantly. | Historical mean: 0.41 events (1981-2020), projected mean: 1.07 (2036-2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean | numeric |\n| 2 | Increased frequency of wet days alongside worsening heat conditions will influence fire risks. | Historical mean wet days: 12.14 (1981-2020), projected mean: 24.71 (2036-2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future projections are based on high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (SSP5-8.5).  \n- Data limitations: Potential variability in climatic models and local factors affecting climate projections.  \n- Confidence statements: Confidence in projections is moderate due to inherent uncertainties in climate modeling.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Adjust insurance models to account for increasing heat wave frequency and resulting wildfire risk.  \n2. Develop educational programs to inform property owners about proactive risk management strategies.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Heat wave\": A prolonged period of excessively hot weather.  \n- \"Climate risk\": The potential for adverse effects from climate variability and change.
