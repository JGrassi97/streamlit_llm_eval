  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the systemic financial risks that climate change poses to the agricultural lending portfolios of banks in the US Midwest?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change poses significant risks through increased temperature and variability in precipitation, impacting agricultural yields and financial stability for banks.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate change is expected to elevate temperatures and alter precipitation patterns in the US Midwest, which can lead to inconsistent agricultural productivity. The projected warming trend of nearly 2°C by 2040 and changing precipitation patterns, including reduced rainfall in critical months, may negatively affect crop yields. This variability could result in increased loan defaults among farmers and heightened risk in agricultural lending portfolios. Hence, banks need to reassess their risk models and develop strategies to mitigate these systemic financial risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average temperature is projected to rise by 2°C in the next two decades. | Monthly mean temperature will increase from 12.8°C (2020-2029) to 14.35°C (2040-2049) in May. | Climate Data | Numeric | \n| 2 | Variations in precipitation levels indicate increased risk for agricultural yield stability. | Average July precipitation decreases from 12.19mm (2020-2029) to 2.22mm (2040-2049). | Climate Data | Numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future climate projections based on current trends.  \n- Data limitations: Projections depend on several variables, including government policies and technological advancements.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence due to reliance on climate models that may not encompass future changes. \n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Banks should incorporate climate risk assessments in their lending criteria for agricultural portfolios.  \n2. Establish partnerships with agricultural stakeholders to develop adaptive strategies for farmers facing climate-related challenges.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Systemic financial risks refer to the potential for widespread economic disruption due to interconnected financial and environmental factors.  \n- The mention of temperature and precipitation implies variables that influence crop growth and agricultural productivity.
