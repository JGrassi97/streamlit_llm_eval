  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat effects are anticipated from changes in precipitation on water infrastructure in Khartoum, Sudan by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nDecreased precipitation and increased temperatures will likely strain water infrastructure, leading to reduced water availability and increased evaporation.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, Khartoum is expected to face a significant decline in precipitation, especially during the rainy months (July to October), coupled with rising temperatures. This dual trend poses risks to water infrastructure, including reduced water availability and increased evaporation, which may contribute to water scarcity. As a result, infrastructure resilience strategies will become essential, focusing on improving storage solutions, promoting water conservation, and diversifying water sources to ensure a sustainable supply amidst these changes.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Anticipated decline in precipitation during rainy months will reduce water availability. | Monthly mean precipitation data shows decreased values from 2030-2040. | Climate Data Analysis | Numeric |\n| 2 | Rising temperatures enhance evaporation rates from water bodies. | Expected temperature increases in summer months noted in climate indicators. | Climate Data Analysis | Numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on historical data trends; uncertainties remain regarding variability of climate patterns.  \n- Data limitations: Specific projections from climate models were not retrievable.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in trends based on observed data but lower confidence in precise future values due to model inconsistencies.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement increased water storage solutions to mitigate losses from evaporation.\n2. Develop comprehensive water conservation campaigns and alternative sourcing strategies.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Evaporation\" refers to the process where liquid water turns into vapor, which can impact water levels and availability in reservoirs.  \n- \"Infrastructure resilience\" denotes the capacity of water systems to withstand changes and challenges posed by climatic effects.",
