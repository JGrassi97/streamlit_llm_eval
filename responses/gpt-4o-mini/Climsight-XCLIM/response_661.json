  "QuestionText": "What influence will projected temperature changes have on solar panel efficiency in the Sahara region, Algeria by 2050?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat influence will projected temperature changes have on solar panel efficiency in the Sahara region, Algeria by 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected temperature increases are likely to reduce solar panel efficiency by about 0.45% for every 1°C rise, significantly impacting their performance.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nIn the Sahara region of Algeria, rising temperatures projected for 2050 indicate a negative impact on solar panel efficiency, which decreases by approximately 0.45% for each additional degree Celsius. Current climate systems exhibit mean temperature increases and may reach maximum daily temperatures exceeding critical thresholds by 2050. As a result, adaptations such as cooling systems for solar panels could become essential if efficiency losses are to be mitigated. The combined effects of heightened temperatures and changing precipitation patterns necessitate careful planning to ensure the sustainability of solar energy systems in this region.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Solar panel efficiency decreases with temperature increase. | For every 1°C increase, efficiency drops by 0.45%. | N/A | numeric | \n| 2 | Average temperatures are expected to rise significantly by 2050. | Historical mean temperature rising trend: 0.06 K/year. | N/A | numeric | \n| 3 | Maximum daily temperatures are projected to increase. | Maximum temperature expected to reach 312.77 K by 2050. | N/A | numeric | \n| 4 | No days have currently exceeded 35°C but projections differ. | Historical data indicates 0 days exceeding 35°C. | N/A | numeric | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections based on past climate data and models for 2050.  \n- Data limitations: Some data points are historical and future projections may vary.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature trends but uncertainty in technology adaptation impacts.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in advanced cooling technologies or designs for solar panels to mitigate efficiency losses in higher temperatures.  \n2. Explore alternative solar technologies that perform better under extreme heat conditions.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Solar panel efficiency refers to the ratio of electrical output to the sunlight incident on the panel.  \n- Temperature thresholds impact the performance and lifespan of solar panels, which can lead to decreased energy production in extreme heat.",
