  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate change affect the valuation of long-term infrastructure investments in coastal Australian cities like Sydney by 2040? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change may significantly lower the valuation of long-term infrastructure due to increased flooding, rising temperatures, and intensified storms.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, climate change is projected to elevate risks to infrastructure investments in Sydney, notably due to rising sea levels and increased flooding events. Historical data shows a rising trend in days exceeding key temperature thresholds, indicating that heat-related stresses will become more frequent. Projections suggest significant increases in extreme heat days and flooding risks, resulting in higher maintenance costs and reduced asset longevity. This scenario presents substantial risks for urban planning and financial assessment of long-term infrastructure, including roads and public transport systems.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased frequency of extreme heat days will stress infrastructure. | Historical data shows a trend of increasing days exceeding 30°C from 3.54 days (1981-2020) to a projected 7.84 days (2036-2050). | XCLIM_AI | numeric | \n| 2 | Flood risk is heightened by climate change. | Coastal areas are becoming increasingly vulnerable to flooding from rising sea levels and storm surges. | Wikipedia | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on high-emission scenarios with assumed steady population growth.  \n- Data limitations: Data on the economic impacts specific to infrastructure investments in Sydney is limited.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature projections, moderate confidence in economic implications due to variability in local governance and response strategies.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement adaptive infrastructure design strategies to mitigate flooding and heat effects.  \n2. Regularly update risk assessments to align with the latest climate projections and adjust investment strategies accordingly.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Flooding**: The overflow of water onto normally dry land, raising concerns about infrastructure integrity.  \n- **Extreme heat days**: Days where temperatures exceed a certain threshold, which can impact both health and structural materials.
