  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will future climate conditions impact the mix of renewable energy sources in Germany by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFuture climate conditions will enhance solar energy potential while posing risks for hydroelectric generation in Germany by 2035.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, climate conditions in Germany are expected to lead to increased average temperatures, which may enhance solar energy production, projected to rise from 6.68 °C in May to 8.1 °C and from 14.92 °C in July to 15.61 °C on average. Conversely, altered precipitation patterns suggest a potential decrease in water availability for hydroelectric power generation, with no significant rise expected in total precipitation. This duality in climate effects may necessitate adaptations in energy strategies, particularly enhancing energy storage systems and diversifying into sustainable energy alternatives to balance the energy mix and mitigate risks associated with reduced hydroelectric output.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased temperatures may enhance solar energy production. | Historical temperature data suggests stable trends conducive to solar efficiency, with the average July temperature expected to rise to 15.61 °C by 2035. | Climate Model Data | citation |\n| 2 | Stagnant precipitation may hinder hydroelectric generation. | Projections indicate no significant changes in precipitation levels by 2035, with averages remaining around 75.64 mm in July. | Climate Model Data | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assessments stem from CMIP6 multi-model projections which incorporate varying climate pathways.  \n- Data limitations: Lack of variability in rainfall data restricts robust statistical significance.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence exists within projections, particularly concerning precipitation levels and their potential implications for hydropower.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in energy storage technologies to accommodate fluctuations in renewable energy output, ensuring reliability in response to changing production levels.  \n2. Explore alternative renewable energy sources, such as wind or biomass, to diversify the energy mix and mitigate risks associated with decreased hydroelectric potential.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Renewable energy: Energy generated from natural resources that are replenished faster than they are consumed, such as solar power and hydroelectric power.  \n- CMIP6: Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, a framework for climate modeling to provide predictions regarding climate change impacts.",
