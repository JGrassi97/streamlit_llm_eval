  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat impact might expected temperature changes have on energy demand in Cairo, Egypt over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures in Cairo will significantly increase energy demand for cooling systems.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nProjected increases in Cooling Degree Days (CDD) indicate a substantial rise in energy demand for cooling in Cairo over the next two decades, driven by higher temperatures. Historical data shows a mean CDD rise from 2263.35 (1981-2020) to 2479.01 (2021-2035), with further increases expected to 2655.28 (2036-2050). This growing demand necessitates urgent updates to energy infrastructure and urban planning to ensure reliable supply and mitigate potential public health risks during extreme heat events.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Projected increase in Cooling Degree Days for Cairo | Mean CDD rises from 2263.35 (1981-2020) to 2479.01 (2021-2035) and 2655.28 (2036-2050) | XCLIM climate analysis | citation | \n| 2 | Increased energy demand for cooling due to higher temperatures | Significant upward trend in CDD indicates greater cooling needs | XCLIM climate analysis | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Trends based on historical data from 1981 to projected data until 2050.  \n- Data limitations: Limited to CDD; other energy demand factors may not be fully accounted for.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trend due to statistically significant data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Urban planners should integrate cooling demand forecasts into energy supply strategies.  \n2. Energy suppliers must evaluate and upgrade infrastructure to meet rising cooling energy requirements.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Cooling Degree Days (CDD) measure energy needed for air conditioning based on temperature thresholds.  \n- Urban planners are city officials who improve services and infrastructure to enhance living conditions.
