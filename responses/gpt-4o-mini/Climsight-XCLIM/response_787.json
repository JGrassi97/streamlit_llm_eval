  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might future temperature conditions influence the stability of financial markets in Nouakchott, Mauritania over the coming decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures in Nouakchott are projected to increase agricultural risks, potentially destabilizing financial markets.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nFuture temperature conditions in Nouakchott, Mauritania, are expected to rise significantly, with average temperatures increasing from 25.69 °C to 27.12 °C by 2050. This trend risks agricultural output and resource availability, particularly due to heat-sensitive crops, leading to increased water demands and economic instability. Notably, the frequency of extreme temperature days is projected to intensify, which may strain local economies reliant on agriculture. Consequently, financial markets may face instability as agricultural productivity decreases, posing risks to food security and income for the population.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average temperatures are expected to rise significantly by 2050. | Projected increase from 25.69 °C to 27.12 °C. | Climate analysis report | citation |\n| 2 | Increased frequency of extreme temperature days may impact agriculture. | Historical data indicates alarming trends of prolonged heat exposure affecting yield. | Climate analysis report | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean for SSP5-8.5.  \n- Data limitations: Potential gaps in localized economic impacts and adaptive capacity responses.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in the temperature increase projections; moderate confidence regarding economic impacts due to varying adaptive responses.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement sustainable agricultural practices, including heat-resistant crops and improved irrigation techniques.  \n2. Enhance infrastructure for better resource management to mitigate risks from extreme weather events.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"CMIP6 HighResMIP\": A climate model used for predicting future climate conditions based on different scenarios.\n- \"SSP5-8.5\": A scenario representing high levels of greenhouse gas emissions leading to significant climate change.
