  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat changes to energy infrastructure will be needed in the Nordic countries to adapt to new climate realities over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nSignificant upgrades and diversification of energy sources will be necessary to enhance resilience against rising temperatures and extreme weather.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nThe Nordic countries will require substantial changes in their energy infrastructure over the next two decades in response to climate reality shifts. Key drivers include rising temperatures leading to increased energy demands, particularly for cooling, and altered precipitation patterns that could diminish hydroelectric generation potential. Enhanced investments in wind and solar power are necessary, as efficiency is expected to improve. Additionally, infrastructure must be reinforced to withstand more frequent extreme weather events, ensuring a reliable energy supply amid significant climate variability and population growth projections indicating a rise in energy consumption.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures will increase energy demands. | Projections indicate a rise in maximum temperatures, leading to a predicted increase in energy usage for cooling from 6.02 days to 13.2 days above 25 °C by 2050. | Climate indicators for Stockholm | dataset |\n| 2 | Shifts in precipitation can affect hydroelectric resources. | Anticipated reduction in cold precipitation days from 27.98 days historically to 16.72 days by 2050 suggests a decline in freshwater availability impacting hydroelectric generation. | Climate indicators for Stockholm | dataset |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Changes in temperature and precipitation are based on historical data and climate model projections for the Nordic region.  \n- Data limitations: Forecasts may vary based on global climate policies and local mitigation efforts; specific regional models may yield different results.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence level based on established climate models and projections from reliable datasets.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar, enhancing grid infrastructure to support integration and storage solutions for energy stability.  \n2. Reinforce existing energy infrastructure to withstand potential extreme weather conditions, such as floods and storms, ensuring reliability even during climate variability.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Energy infrastructure** refers to the systems and facilities necessary for the production, transmission, and distribution of energy, which will need to adapt to evolving demands and challenges.  \n- **Hydroelectric generation** is a renewable energy source that relies on water flow to produce electricity, making it vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns.",
