  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving wind patterns affect financial risk planning in Oujda, Morocco during 2020-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nEvolving wind patterns indicate decreased windy days and slightly increased wind speeds, prompting reevaluation of infrastructure and agriculture in financial planning.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nThe analysis of wind patterns in Oujda, Morocco shows a trend of **decreasing windy days**, from an average of **50.78 days (1981-2020)** to a projected **43.63 days (2036-2050)**. Unless addressed, this decline may impact energy production and agricultural resilience, modifying risk profiles in these sectors. Conversely, infrastructure may require adjusted designs to account for lower wind-related stress. As wind dynamics evolve, **financial risk planning** needs to incorporate these elements, influencing investments and insurance strategies to ensure sustainability and resilience amid changing climate conditions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Windy days are decreasing in Oujda. | Historical average of 50.78 days (1981-2020) declining to 43.63 days (2036-2050). | XCLIM Analysis Report | numeric | \n| 2 | Minimum near-surface maximum wind speed is slightly increasing. | Historical mean of 5.08 m/s with projections suggesting stability. | XCLIM Analysis Report | numeric | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Historical (1981-2020) to projections (2036-2050).  \n- Data limitations: Non-significant p-values suggest trends might not be statistically robust.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence given the variability and lack of significant trends.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Reassess energy sector strategies to adapt to decreasing windy days affecting wind power generation.  \n2. Update agricultural financial models to account for changing wind impacts on crop health and moisture.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Windy Days Indicator**: Measures how many days exceed a certain wind speed threshold annually, relevant for understanding climate impact on infrastructure and agriculture.  \n- **Minimum near-surface maximum wind speed**: Refers to the lowest maximum wind speed recorded, indicating the level of wind-related stress potential on structures.",
