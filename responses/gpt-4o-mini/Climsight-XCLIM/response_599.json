  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the potential financial impact of increased summer temperatures on the operating costs (e.g., cooling) for data centers located near Dublin, Ireland, over the next 20 years? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased summer temperatures are projected to significantly raise cooling costs for data centers in Dublin over the next 20 years due to a rise in cooling degree days.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nData centers in Dublin are anticipated to face increased operational costs due to rising summer temperatures. Projections indicate a growth in cooling degree days, suggesting a heightened demand for energy-intensive cooling solutions. Historical data shows a consistent trend towards warmer summers, with an expected increase of around 19.42 cooling degree days by 2050. This trend implies financial implications for data centers, necessitating investments in advanced cooling technologies and energy management strategies to manage rising costs and enhance efficiency.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased summer temperatures will enhance data center cooling costs. | Cooling degree days expected to rise to 19.42 by 2050. | Dataset Reference: “CMIP6 HighResMIP” | numeric | \n| 2 | Historical cooling degree days show a significant upward trend. | Historical mean of 6.24°C days with an increasing trend. | Dataset Reference: “CMIP6 HighResMIP” | numeric | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on the SSP5-8.5 emission scenario.  \n- Data limitations: No specific financial models were located for operational cost estimates.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in temperature projections, high confidence in the trend of increasing cooling degree days.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in energy-efficient cooling systems and technologies to manage rising costs effectively.  \n2. Develop a contingency plan integrating sustainability practices to mitigate potential financial impacts on cooling demands.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Cooling degree days (CDD): A measure used to estimate energy demand for cooling based on how much the average temperature exceeds a reference level.  \n- SSP5-8.5: A scenario that represents high greenhouse gas emissions leading to significant climate change impacts.",
