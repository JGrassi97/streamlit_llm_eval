  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could changes in average winter temperatures affect the demand on the power grid for heating in Moscow, Russia, during the 2040-2050 period?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nDecreasing average winter temperatures will likely increase the demand on Moscow’s heating power grid due to rising Heating Degree Days (HDD).\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nIn Moscow, the average Heating Degree Days (HDD) from 2036 to 2050 is projected to drop to 3,880.71 °C-days, which marks a significant reduction from the historical average of 4,468.95 °C-days. As temperatures decline, heating demand increases, directly impacting the grid's operational capacity and necessitating infrastructure adaptations. The first day with temperatures falling below the freezing point is also likely to occur later, indicating potential shifts in heating requirements. Authorities should prepare for increased energy demand during colder months, which could lead to reliability issues if not addressed.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average HDD in Moscow will decrease to 3,880.71 °C-days by 2050. | Mean HDD for 2036-2050: 3,880.71 °C-days | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Historical average HDD was 4,468.95 °C-days. | Mean HDD for historical period (1981-2020): 4,468.95 °C-days | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections derived from CMIP6 models for SSP5-8.5 scenario.  \n- Data limitations: Variability in historical HDD estimates; reliance on climate models for future estimations.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in projections based on model reliability.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Enhance the resilience of the power grid through infrastructure upgrades to manage increased heating demand.  \n2. Implement demand-side management strategies to optimize energy consumption during peak heating periods.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Heating Degree Days (HDD) are a measure of the demand for energy needed to heat a building.  \n- Degrees Celsius (°C) measures temperature.",
