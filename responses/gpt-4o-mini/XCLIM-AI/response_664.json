  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will evolving temperature conditions affect the efficiency of geothermal plants in the East African Rift, Ethiopia by mid-century?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nEvolving temperature conditions will likely enhance geothermal plant efficiency by increasing thermal energy extraction potential.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy mid-century, average temperatures in the East African Rift are projected to increase, influencing the operation of geothermal plants. Enhanced mean temperatures and the associated changes in daily temperature ranges can increase the thermal energy available for extraction. The historical data indicates a consistent increase in both average minimum and maximum temperatures, with indications of continued growth. However, the overall efficiency gains could be tempered by potential increases in variability and extreme temperature events, which can affect operational reliability. \n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average mean temperatures are projected to increase. | Historical temperatures indicate a mean increase of approximately 1.58 °C. | dataset \"CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).\" | citation | \n| 2 | Short-term and medium-term increases in temperature are expected. | Mean temperature is projected to rise by 0.1 °C between 2021-2035 and by 0.4 °C between 2036-2050. | dataset \"CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).\" | citation | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenarios.  \n- Data limitations: Data is dependent on the accuracy of climate models and may not capture all local variations.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trends; however, local impacts may vary significantly.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in adaptive technologies for geothermal plants to optimize efficiency during extreme temperature events.  \n2. Conduct localized feasibility assessments to identify specific geothermal resource capacities in light of projected climate changes.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Geothermal plants\" use heat from the Earth to generate energy, which can be affected by temperature differences.  \n- \"Thermal energy extraction\" refers to the process of capturing heat for electricity production from the Earth’s interior.",
