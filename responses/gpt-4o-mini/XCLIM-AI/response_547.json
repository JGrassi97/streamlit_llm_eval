  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate change influence the burden of disease in Central Asian nations over the next 20 to 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is likely to exacerbate health issues in Central Asia due to increased heatwaves, altered disease vectors, and water scarcity.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next 20 to 30 years, climate change will significantly impact public health in Central Asia, leading to heightened risks of heat-related illnesses, respiratory diseases, and vector-borne diseases. Increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns will intensify heatwaves, affecting vulnerable populations and stressing health systems. Water scarcity will further complicate sanitation and hygiene, potentially increasing the prevalence of waterborne diseases. Agricultural shifts could influence food security, leading to malnutrition and associated health concerns. Addressing these challenges requires improving healthcare resilience and implementing effective climate adaptation strategies.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heatwaves will increase health risks | Increased frequency of extreme heat events projected due to climate models | \"CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)\" | citation |\n| 2 | Water scarcity affects hygiene and disease | Reduced water availability is projected for the region | \"CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)\" | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future scenarios are based on high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenarios which represent worst-case climate impacts.  \n- Data limitations: Limited local climate impact studies specifically focused on health outcomes in Central Asia.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on climate models, but high uncertainty in localized health data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Enhance public health infrastructure to manage heat-related illnesses and equip facilities with cooling centers.  \n2. Develop educational campaigns focused on vector-borne disease prevention and water management strategies.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Heatwaves**: prolonged periods of excessively hot weather, often combined with high humidity.  \n- **Vector-borne diseases**: diseases transmitted by organisms like mosquitoes and ticks (e.g., malaria, dengue).  \n- **Water scarcity**: a situation where the demand for water exceeds the available supply.
