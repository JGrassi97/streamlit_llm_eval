  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat role will future climate variability play in affecting the resilience of coastal energy infrastructure in Tunis, Tunisia in the coming decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFuture climate variability will significantly increase temperatures, alter precipitation patterns, and exacerbate extreme weather events, posing risks to coastal energy infrastructure resilience in Tunis.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAs climate variability intensifies, Tunis is projected to experience warmer nights and increased heat waves, with an increase in tropical nights from 79.78 days to 111.91 days by 2050, a significant climate stressor. This is compounded by expected fluctuations in precipitation, with greater total accumulation during wet days but fewer rainy days, leading to potential flooding risks. Rising average temperatures will place additional stress on energy infrastructure, particularly coastal systems susceptible to storms and sea-level rise. These changes necessitate adaptive measures to enhance resilience in energy supply chains and infrastructure planning.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increase in tropical nights significantly increases warm night frequency. | Future mean for tropical nights expected to rise to 111.91 days by 2050, from a historical mean of 79.78 days. | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).” | numeric |\n| 2 | Heat waves frequency is likely to rise. | Historical mean of heat waves is 3.94, increasing in the short-term to 4.7 days and medium-term to 5.39 days. | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).” | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Predictions based on high-emission scenario SSP5–8.5.  \n- Data limitations: Model variability in climate predictions; local conditions can further impact results.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature projections, moderate uncertainty in precipitation variability.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement infrastructure upgrades to enhance resilience against extreme temperatures and flooding events.  \n2. Develop early-warning systems and emergency response strategies for energy infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of heat waves and storm surges.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Tropical nights refer to nights where temperatures remain above 20°C, which can affect sleep quality and health.  \n- Heat waves are periods of excessively hot weather, often affecting energy demand and system reliability.",
