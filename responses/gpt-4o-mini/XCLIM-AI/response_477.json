  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat role will projected increases in average temperature play in the performance and cooling requirements of geothermal power plants in Iceland through 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased average temperatures are expected to elevate cooling demands and operational efficiency challenges for geothermal plants in Iceland by 2040.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected temperature increases in Iceland will significantly influence the performance and cooling requirements of geothermal power plants. The Cooling Degree Days (CDD) approximation indicates a rise from a historical mean of approximately 6.27 days to around 10.09 days by 2040, suggesting increased cooling demand. Furthermore, the frequency of days exceeding temperature thresholds will impact the efficiency of geothermal systems. As the average temperature rises, these plants will face operational challenges and could require additional cooling options to maintain performance and efficiency, making infrastructure adaptation essential.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased Cooling Degree Days indicate rising cooling demand | Historical mean CDD: 6.27 days; Future mean CDD (2036-2050): 10.09 days | \"CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)\" | numeric |\n| 2 | Zero days above critical heat thresholds forecasted | No days exceeding thresholds (22°C for min, 30°C for max) recorded historically and short-term | \"CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)\" | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Temperature and precipitation projections based on climate model ensemble mean.  \n- Data limitations: Reliance on model projections, which may carry inherent uncertainties.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in trends, but variability in projections exists.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Begin infrastructure evaluations to enhance cooling capabilities in existing geothermal facilities.  \n2. Invest in research for adaptive technologies that improve geothermal efficiency in warmer conditions.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Cooling Degree Days (CDD) quantifies days when temperatures exceed a threshold, indicating cooling requirements.\n- CDD levels suggest operational adjustment needs for geothermal facilities as climate conditions evolve.",
