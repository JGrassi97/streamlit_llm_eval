  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat changes to energy infrastructure will be needed in the Nordic countries to adapt to new climate realities over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nNordic countries will need to enhance renewable energy capacity, improve grid resilience, and invest in energy storage solutions.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nAs the Nordic countries face warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns due to climate change, adapting energy infrastructure is essential. Investments in renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar, are crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet rising energy demands. Enhancing grid infrastructure will be necessary to accommodate variable renewable energy production and improve resilience against extreme weather events. Additionally, developing advanced energy storage technologies will enable the integration of renewables and ensure a stable energy supply. This transition not only addresses environmental challenges but also presents opportunities for economic growth and energy independence.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Transition to renewables is crucial for emissions reduction. | Renewable energy sources can account for over 70% of the electricity generation by 2040 in the Nordic region. | *\"Nordic Energy Outlook 2021\"* | citation |\n| 2 | Climate change is increasing energy demand due to higher temperatures. | Energy demand in the Nordic countries is expected to rise by 25% over the next two decades. | *Nordic Council of Ministers Report* | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future climate projections suggest increased temperature variability and potential shifts in precipitation patterns affecting energy demand and production.  \n- Data limitations: Current models may not fully capture localized climate effects or rapid technological advancements in energy storage.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in projected increases in renewable energy capacity and energy demand growth, but moderate uncertainty regarding the pace of infrastructure adaptation.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in upgrading grid infrastructure to support a decentralized renewable energy system and improve reliability.  \n2. Promote research and development in energy storage solutions to facilitate the transition and integration of variable renewable energy.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Renewable energy**: Energy from sources that are naturally replenished, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.  \n- **Grid resilience**: The ability of the electricity grid to withstand and recover from disruptions caused by extreme weather or other events.",
