  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will climate change affect the long-term risk projections for infrastructure investments in Agadir, Morocco by 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, posing significant risks to infrastructure investments in Agadir by 2050.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2050, Agadir is expected to face heightened climate risks due to rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and an increase in extreme weather events. Specifically, projections indicate a potential increase in heatwave occurrences and a decrease in liquid precipitation, which could jeopardize water resources and impact infrastructure integrity. Historical data suggest a trend of decreasing precipitation and an increase in warm days. As climates continue to shift, infrastructure investors will need to prioritize resilience strategies and adapt to more severe climatic conditions to mitigate risks associated with these changes.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average annual precipitation is projected to decrease | Historical average: 241.91 mm, projected short-term average: 228.58 mm for 2021-2035 | N/A | numeric |\n| 2 | Potential increase in heat days | Average number of warm days (above 25°C) expected to increase | N/A | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Uncertain projections on precipitation variability and heat events due to climate modeling limitations.  \n- Data limitations: Historical data may not fully capture future climate variability; reliance on model assumptions.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in trends based on historical data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop adaptive infrastructure designs that account for extreme weather events to enhance resilience.  \n2. Implement water resource management strategies to mitigate the effects of reduced precipitation on urban planning.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Heatwave**: A prolonged period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high humidity.  \n- **Precipitation patterns**: Refers to the trends and changes in rainfall and weather events throughout the year.",
