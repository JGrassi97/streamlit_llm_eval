  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will future climate conditions impact the mix of renewable energy sources in Germany by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFuture climate conditions are expected to reduce the number of rain on frozen ground days, while daily temperature variability may increase, thereby stressing renewable energy systems.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, the number of rain on frozen ground days in Germany is projected to decrease from a historical average of 0.95 to 0.77, affecting groundwater recharge and hydropower generation. Concurrently, daily temperature range variability will remain consistent, suggesting no increase in extremes but potential stress on cold-weather renewable energy systems. These factors present risks for energy generation, particularly for hydropower and wind energy during seasonal transitions. Opportunities lie in adapting energy infrastructure to respond better to reduced winter precipitation and ensuring efficient energy storage solutions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rain on frozen ground days will decrease. | Historical mean 0.95 (1981-2020) vs. projected mean 0.77 (2021-2035). | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).” | numeric |\n| 2 | Daily maximum temperature variability remains stable. | Historical mean temperature range of 2.23 K (1981-2020) indicates stability in extremes. | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).” | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: 1970-2050 projections based on SSP5-8.5.  \n- Data limitations: Single model reference used for projections may not capture full variability.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in future climate impact estimates.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in enhanced energy storage solutions to balance intermittent energy supply.  \n2. Adapt hydropower infrastructure to cope with reduced water inflow during winter.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Rain on frozen ground days\" refers to days when rain falls on frozen surfaces, potentially causing flooding.  \n- \"SSP5-8.5\" is a high-emission scenario projecting significant climate changes.",
