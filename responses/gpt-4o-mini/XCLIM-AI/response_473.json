  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected change in solar panel energy output during summer months in Seville, Spain, due to higher average temperatures between 2030 and 2040? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected changes include a slight increase in solar panel energy output due to improved efficiency at higher average temperatures.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nBetween 2030 and 2040, the average maximum daily temperature in Seville is expected to rise, resulting from climate change impacts. Increased temperatures may enhance solar energy output initially due to improved photovoltaic efficiency in warmer conditions, although efficiency gains level off at higher temperatures. For example, summer months may experience an average output of around 1825.71 kWh, compared to approximately 1752.11 kWh historically. However, risks such as extreme heat events could also stress infrastructure, potentially leading to decreased operational efficiencies.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average solar panel output is projected at 1825.71 kWh in 2030-2040 | Changes in output based on historical data projections | N/A | numeric |\n| 2 | Efficiency of solar panels increases with temperature but peaks before declining | Studies indicate efficiency trends | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on historical climate models and temperature trends.  \n- Data limitations: Variability in short-term heatwaves was not fully considered.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in projections due to known effects of temperature on solar output.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in solar panel technology that is optimized for high-temperature performance to maximize energy output.  \n2. Implement cooling measures or shading strategies for solar installations to enhance operational efficiency during extreme heat events.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Photovoltaics: Technology that converts sunlight directly into electricity.  \n- Efficiency: The ratio of useful output to input, often expressed in percentage terms.",
