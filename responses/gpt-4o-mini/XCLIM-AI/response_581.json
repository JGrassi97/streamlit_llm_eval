  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate variability impact sovereign credit risk for nations heavily dependent on agriculture in Central America by 2040? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate variability could heighten sovereign credit risk in Central America through increased agricultural uncertainty and declining yields.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, climate variability is likely to exacerbate the agricultural challenges faced by Central American nations, leading to increased sovereign credit risk. Key drivers include the predicted end of growing seasons, with an average duration remaining stable at about 365 days, and variability in daily temperature ranges which may disrupt crop yields. These changes can undermine food security, increase inflation, and lead to social unrest, further complicating economic stability. Governments may struggle to meet debt obligations, impacting credit ratings, while adaptation strategies present opportunities for resilience against these climate-related risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | The average end of the growing season remains stable at about 365 days. | Historical (1981-2020) mean of 365.25 days from climate data. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Daily temperature range variability is consistent, indicating potential agricultural risk. | Historical (1981-2020) mean daily temperature range variability of 2.0 K. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Predictive modeling based on historical trends.  \n- Data limitations: Limited by the models used for projections.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in projections due to variability and localized responses to climate change.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement adaptive agricultural practices to mitigate the effects of climate variability on yields.  \n2. Strengthen financial frameworks to support farmers in periods of significant climate-related stress.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Growing season**: The period in which crops can grow, typically influenced by climate.  \n- **Temperature range variability**: Fluctuations in temperature differences between daily highs and lows, which can affect agricultural productivity.  \n",
