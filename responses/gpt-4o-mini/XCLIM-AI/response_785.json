  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving wind patterns affect financial risk planning in Oujda, Morocco during 2020-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nEvolving wind patterns could increase risk exposure from climate-induced events, impacting agricultural yields, energy pricing, and infrastructural integrity.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nChanges in wind patterns in Oujda, Morocco from 2020-2050 may pose significant financial risks. With historical wind speeds averaging around 2.78 m/s showing minimal change, the consistency in wind conditions belies emerging uncertainties related to extreme weather events. Potential increases in heatwaves (maximum temperatures averaging 22.2°C) can adversely affect agricultural productivity, energy consumption, and water resources. Inadequate infrastructure to sustain prolonged wind and heat stress heightens maintenance costs and influences insurance frameworks. Proactive financial strategies are crucial to mitigate these potential disruptions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Wind patterns show little change with minor trends over decades. | Average wind speed for 1981-2020: 2.78 m/s (std. dev 0.15). | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5). | numeric |\n| 2 | Rising temperatures could intensify heat stress on agriculture and infrastructure. | Average maximum temperature: 22.2°C, with a slight decline expected in the near future. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5). | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Utilizing CMIP6 HighResMIP models indicating steady wind patterns; projections may not account for localized extreme changes.  \n- Data limitations: Potential gaps in localized climatic data, particularly for wind extremes; reliance on model averages may overlook variability.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in projections; persistent trends suggest minimal short-term changes.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in climate-resilient agricultural practices to withstand potential heat stress and wind effects.\n2. Enhance infrastructure planning to accommodate changing wind patterns and temperature extremes, ensuring robustness against unforeseen climate events.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Wind patterns\" refer to the prevailing movements of air in the atmosphere influencing climate conditions.\n- \"Heatwaves\" designate sustained periods of excessively hot weather, which may disrupt various sectors and systems.",
