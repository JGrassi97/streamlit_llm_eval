  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of rising temperatures on the financial viability of cattle farming operations in Queensland, Australia, due to increased costs for water and feed by 2040? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures are expected to significantly affect the financial viability of cattle farming in Queensland due to increased costs for water and feed.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, projected increases in temperatures in Queensland will lead to higher water and feed costs for cattle farmers. Enhanced heat stress could reduce livestock productivity and increase mortality rates, thereby straining operational profitability. Additionally, changes in precipitation patterns might exacerbate water scarcity during critical periods, creating challenges for irrigation and pasture growth. Farmers may face increased costs associated with supplemental feeding and veterinary care due to health impacts on herds. Adapting management practices to mitigate these effects will be crucial to maintain economic viability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures linked to higher operational costs. | Historical analysis shows a trend of increasing feed and water prices relative to temperature increases. In Queensland, temperatures are projected to rise. | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).” | citation |\n| 2 | Livestock productivity decreases under heat stress. | Studies indicate that cattle growth rates decline by approximately 10% for every degree Celsius above optimal temperature ranges. | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).” | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on high-emission scenarios overlaid with local climatic data from multiple models.  \n- Data limitations: Limited historical data post-2014 could affect predictions. Regional variations not fully captured.  \n- Confidence statements: Model predictions convey moderate confidence based on historical trends and current observations.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement breeding and management strategies to develop heat-resistant cattle breeds.  \n2. Enhance monitoring systems for water usage and crop irrigation to optimize feed resources.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Heat stress: physiological strain on livestock due to high temperatures, which can lead to decreased productivity and health issues.  \n- Cattle farming: agricultural practice involving the raising and breeding of cattle primarily for meat and milk production.",
