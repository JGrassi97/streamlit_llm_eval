  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the expected financial risks to supply chains originating from manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia due to climate change?  \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change poses significant financial risks to Southeast Asia’s supply chains, primarily due to increased precipitation variability, sea-level rise, and intensified weather events.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nManufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia face heightened financial risks from climate change, characterized by increased precipitation variability and extreme weather events. Historical data indicates minimal occurrences of rain on frozen ground days, but daily precipitation intensity shows a pattern of increasing variability, affecting operational continuity. The erosion of infrastructure and supply routes due to flooding and extreme weather can disrupt logistics and inflate operational costs. Additionally, shifting climate patterns threaten agricultural outputs crucial for supply chains, posing longer-term supply and price volatility risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased daily precipitation intensity and variability could impact logistics. | Historical mean daily precipitation is 9.34 mm with variations; snow and frozen ground events are negligible. | *“CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)”* | numeric |  \n| 2 | Climate change leads to potential operational disruptions in logistics. | The slope of precipitation trends shows significant variability, indicating extreme weather risks. | *“CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)”* | numeric |  \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Trends in global precipitation and temperature changes reflect future operational risks, yet specific local impacts may not be fully represented.  \n- Data limitations: Reliance on historical data may not capture rapid climate shifts accurately.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in predicting operational disruptions linked to increasing climate variability.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of critical supply routes to identify vulnerabilities related to climate impacts, ensuring operational continuity.  \n2. Invest in resilient infrastructure and adaptive supply chain strategies, targeting enhanced flexibility in logistics to mitigate potential disruptions.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Precipitation intensity\" refers to the amount of rainfall over time, which affects the supply chain's reliability.  \n- \"Operational continuity\" signifies a business's ability to maintain critical functions during disruptive events.",
