  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the anticipated impact of wind speed changes on the insurance sector in Casablanca, Morocco by mid-century?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased maximum wind speeds could elevate risk levels for property and infrastructure insurance in Casablanca by mid-century.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nProjected changes in wind speeds due to climate change in Casablanca, Morocco, indicate a potential rise in maximum wind speeds to an average of 38.01 m/s by 2050. This shift could negatively impact the insurance sector, leading to higher claims for property damage and increased premiums. The increase in severe wind events raises concerns over the resilience of infrastructure and the ability of insurance providers to manage risks. These evolving conditions necessitate urgent adaptations in insurance practices to mitigate financial losses and protect insured assets.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average maximum wind speeds are expected to reach 38.01 m/s by 2050. | Mean maximum wind speed for medium-term (2036-2050) is 38.01 m/s. | CMIP6 HighResMIP | numeric |\n| 2 | Minimum wind speeds are also increasing, posing additional risks to infrastructure. | Average minimum wind speed projected to be 6.38 m/s by 2050. | CMIP6 HighResMIP | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Ranges from historical data (1981-2020) to projections up to 2050.  \n- Data limitations: Results rely on model output subject to uncertainties inherent in climate projections.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on statistical significance of trends.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement climate risk assessments to integrate wind speed changes into insurance underwriting processes.\n2. Develop adaptive strategies for infrastructure resilience to manage the increasing risk of wind-related damages.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Wind speed\" refers to the rate at which air is moving in the atmosphere, typically measured in meters per second (m/s).\n- \"Maximum wind speeds\" indicate the highest recorded wind speeds, essential for assessing storm risks and insurance valuation.",
