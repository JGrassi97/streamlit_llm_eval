  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will future climate scenarios influence investment risk in the tourism sector of the Caribbean islands by 2035?  \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFuture climate scenarios, characterized by increased tropical nights and heat waves, will significantly elevate investment risks in the Caribbean tourism sector by 2035.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, the Caribbean tourism sector will face heightened investment risks due to climate change impacts, such as increased tropical nights and heat waves. The number of tropical nights is projected to rise, potentially exceeding 365 days, creating challenges for outdoor activities and visitor comfort. Concurrently, more frequent and intense heat waves are anticipated, which could deter tourists and strain infrastructure. Additionally, changes in rainfall patterns and the increased likelihood of flooding and drought may disrupt local economies reliant on tourism. Stakeholders must adapt strategies to mitigate these risks, focusing on building resilience and enhancing sustainability in tourism planning.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Tropical nights may exceed 365 days by 2035, affecting tourism and comfort | Historical data shows a mean of 365.22 tropical nights with a trend indicating negligible change | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Heat waves forecast to increase, potentially impacting local tourism | Increased heat waves projected with a mean of 4.4 events in 2021-2035 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future projections based on CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 scenario, highlighting potential increases in temperature and precipitation patterns.  \n- Data limitations: Projections depend on available CMIP6 models and could vary with new models and scenarios.  \n- Confidence statements: There is a moderate level of confidence in projections based on historical data trends, but local adaptation features might introduce variability.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in climate resilience measures for tourism infrastructure, including cooling systems and flood management strategies.  \n2. Develop marketing strategies that emphasize adaptability to climate variability, promoting alternative tourism offerings during peak heat periods.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Tropical nights: Days where nighttime temperatures remain above 20°C, affecting comfort for tourists.\n- Heat waves: Extended periods where temperatures exceed defined thresholds (often 30°C), impacting outdoor activities.",
