  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected impact of changing precipitation patterns on the viability of run-of-the-river hydropower projects in the Alps of Switzerland by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nChanging precipitation patterns may reduce water availability for run-of-the-river hydropower projects, impacting energy production stability.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nThe viability of run-of-the-river hydropower projects in the Swiss Alps by 2040 is challenged by projected decreases in wet days and total accumulated precipitation. Historical trends show a mean of 0.56 wet days, reducing to a projected 0.54 by 2050, coupled with a mean total precipitation accumulation of approximately 2017 mm, declining slightly in future projections. These factors collectively indicate a potential drop in water inflow during critical periods for energy generation, increasing the risk of energy supply inconsistencies as demand rises in the face of climate impacts.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Projected reduction in wet days from 0.56 to 0.54 by 2050. | Yearly mean wet days data indicates a slight decline. | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).” | citation |\n| 2 | Total accumulated precipitation projected to decline from ~2017 mm. | Mean total precipitation shows a slight decrease in projections. | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).” | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future projections are based on SSP585 scenario.  \n- Data limitations: Projections depend on the accuracy of climate models and assumptions regarding emissions pathways.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in presented trends based on multi-model ensemble data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement technical solutions for water storage to ensure consistent power supply during low precipitation periods.  \n2. Invest in diversification of energy sources to mitigate risks associated with reduced hydropower reliability.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Run-of-the-river: A hydropower generation method without significant water storage, relying on river flow.",
