  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat public health challenges will arise from climate change in the densely populated river deltas of Southeast Asia over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased heatwaves and humidity will exacerbate health risks, strain healthcare systems, and elevate the incidence of vector-borne diseases.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate change is predicted to significantly impact public health in Southeast Asia's river deltas over the next two decades. Rising temperatures will lead to more frequent heatwaves, with historical averages indicating up to 355 days classified as heatwave conditions per year by the mid-2050s. The Humidex, reflecting increased discomfort levels due to humidity and temperature, is also expected to rise substantially (mean levels reaching approximately 40°C). These changes will heighten heat-related illnesses and increase the prevalence of diseases such as dengue fever and malaria, stressing limited healthcare resources and compromising population health in these densely populated regions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heatwave frequency is increasing. | Average projected days classified as heatwave events is 355 by 2050. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5). | citation |  \n| 2 | Humidity will increase discomfort levels. | Humidex levels expected to rise to nearly 40°C by mid-century. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5). | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Predictions are based on unverified models projecting heatwave and humidity trends.  \n- Data limitations: Model reliance on average conditions may not capture localized variability.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in projected outcomes, but regional disparities may exist.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Enhance public health infrastructure to better manage heat-related illnesses and increase surveillance of vector-borne disease outbreaks.  \n2. Implement community awareness programs promoting heat stress prevention and identifying symptoms of heat-related health risks.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Humidex**: A measure that combines temperature and humidity to describe how hot it feels to humans.  \n- **Heatwave**: A prolonged period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high humidity.",
