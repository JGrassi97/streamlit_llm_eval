  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected impact of climate change on energy infrastructure resilience in coastal Louisiana, USA, over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is expected to significantly undermine energy infrastructure resilience in coastal Louisiana due to increasing temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and rising sea levels.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nCoastal Louisiana's energy infrastructure faces heightened risks from climate change over the next two decades. Increased average temperatures may exacerbate energy demand, while projected declines in wet days and shifts in precipitation can lead to prolonged droughts or flooding, impacting energy supply chains. The normalized Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) indicates likely water stress. Additionally, the risk of heatwaves is projected to escalate, leading to potential energy system failures. Adaptation measures will be critical in mitigating these risks and ensuring energy resilience amidst these projected changes.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | SPEI indicates increasing water stress in coastal Louisiana. | Historical SPEI averages indicate a decrease from 0.1 to -0.27 in the medium term. | CMIP6 HighResMIP dataset | citation |\n| 2 | Rising temperatures and heatwaves will challenge energy infrastructure. | Expected maximum temperature days above 30°C to increase from 106.34 to 104.98. | CMIP6 HighResMIP dataset | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections based on CMIP6 HighResMIP model ensembles.  \n- Data limitations: Potential gaps in temporal and spatial coverage of local data.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence; projections are subject to local adaptation measures and broader climate trends.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement adaptive management strategies for energy infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events.  \n2. Enhance monitoring and forecasting capabilities for precipitation and temperature extremes to better prepare and respond to resource challenges.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **SPEI**: Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, a measure of water balance.  \n- **CMIP6**: Sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, providing climate model data.
