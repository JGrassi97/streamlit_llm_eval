  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will climate risk be integrated into property insurance pricing in wildfire-prone areas of California over the next decade? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProperty insurance pricing in wildfire-prone California will increasingly incorporate climate risk factors such as heat wave frequency and intensity, driven by changing weather patterns, regulatory pressures, and marketplace demands for resilience.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next decade, climate risk will be a significant determinant in property insurance pricing for wildfire-prone areas in California. Insurers are expected to adjust premiums based on increased heat wave occurrences, higher average temperatures, and heightened wildfire risks. As the average heat wave index rises, reflecting longer and more intense heat events, insurers may implement increased pricing margins to balance potential payouts. Additionally, regulatory frameworks and consumer awareness around climate resilience will further push insurers to adopt more robust risk assessment tools. This evolution may create pricing discrepancies, impacting affordability and accessibility of coverage for at-risk homeowners.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | The average heat wave frequency is projected to rise from a historical mean of 0.41 days to 1.07 days by 2050. | Historical data indicates a trend showing an increase from 0.41 days in 1981-2020 to a projected 1.07 days in the medium term (2036-2050). | \"CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)\" | numeric |\n| 2 | The average maximum daily temperature is expected to increase over time, affecting the risk assessment for insurers. | The average maximum temperature across historical, short-term, and medium-term assessments shows a positive trend. | \"CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)\" | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Long-term projections assume consistent climate models and emission scenarios (SSP5-8.5).  \n- Data limitations: Projections are based on multi-model ensemble means, potentially masking localized variabilities.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in trends given the reliance on robust climate projections.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop enhanced underwriting policies that specifically account for increased climate risks, including detailed analysis of projected heat wave frequency and related temperature increases.\n2. Implement consumer education initiatives highlighting the importance of climate resilience, which may help homeowners prepare and mitigate risks.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Heat wave index: A measure quantifying the number of days where temperatures exceed certain thresholds, indicating increased risk levels.\n- Climate risk: Refers to the potential negative impacts arising from changing climate conditions, which could affect events like wildfires and heat waves.",
