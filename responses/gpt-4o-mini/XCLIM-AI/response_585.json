  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate change affect the valuation of long-term infrastructure investments in coastal Australian cities like Sydney by 2040? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change may significantly increase costs due to more frequent heat waves, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, Sydney's infrastructure investments are likely to be heavily impacted by climate change factors such as increased heat wave frequency (up to 0.54 heat waves per year compared to historical levels) and higher average temperatures (mean of 39.69°C in summer). The rise in sea levels and increased precipitation will heighten flood risks, consequently affecting property value and insurance costs. The compounded effect of these elements could lead to a reevaluation of infrastructure resilience and costs, necessitating proactive adaptation measures to mitigate financial risks and ensure sustainability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heat wave frequency in Sydney is expected to increase significantly by 2040. | Average of 0.54 heat waves in the medium term (2036-2050) compared to historical averages. | N/A | numeric |\n| 2 | Average summer temperatures may reach 39.69°C. | Summer temperature measurements indicate a mean of 39.69°C historically. | N/A | numeric | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on historical climate data and anticipated trends.  \n- Data limitations: Climate models have inherent uncertainties and may not capture all local conditions accurately.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence due to reliance on modeling outputs and projected climate scenarios.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure that can withstand more frequent and severe weather events.  \n2. Conduct regular assessments of property values and insurance metrics to adjust for climate change impacts.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Heat wave frequency: The number of occurrences of days when temperatures exceed a certain threshold.\n- Infrastructure valuation: The process of determining the worth of physical structures in light of changing environmental conditions.",
