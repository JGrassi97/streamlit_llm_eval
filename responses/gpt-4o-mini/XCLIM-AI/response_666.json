  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might temperature increases influence the maintenance needs of electrical grid networks in Tripoli, Libya throughout 2030-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased temperatures are likely to heighten maintenance needs for electrical grids in Tripoli due to more frequent heatwaves and stress on infrastructure.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nProjected temperature increases in Tripoli, Libya, can lead to a significant rise in the number of extreme heat days, from 76.5 days in the historical period to an expected 106.08 days by 2050. This can escalate the thermal stress on electrical grid infrastructure, resulting in heightened maintenance needs. Adaptations will be necessary to avoid grid failures and reduce energy loss during peak demands. Proactive measures can mitigate risks but require investment in upgrades and heat-resistant technologies. \n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heatwave days are projected to increase significantly by 2050. | 76.5 days (1981-2020) to 106.08 days (2036-2050). | N/A | numeric |\n| 2 | Electrical grid stress is expected to rise during peak temperature days. | Greater thermal stress leads to increased maintenance needs. | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Historical data trends suggest a steady increase in heat days.  \n- Data limitations: Projections rely on historical temperature data which may not account for extreme deviations.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence based on warming trends observed in the historical dataset.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement heat-resistant materials and technology upgrades in grid infrastructure.  \n2. Conduct regular assessments to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities of grid systems during extreme temperature events.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Heatwave: A prolonged period of excessively hot weather.  \n- Thermal stress: Damage to materials and infrastructure caused by high temperatures.  \n- Infrastructure: Facilities and equipment required for the operation of electrical systems.",
