  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will the health impacts of climate change differ between urban and rural populations in India by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nUrban populations will face higher heat-related health risks and air quality issues, while rural populations will suffer more from water-related diseases and agricultural impacts.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, urban populations in India are expected to experience amplified health impacts from climate change, particularly from extreme heat events leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Higher urban temperatures due to urban heat islands can exacerbate respiratory conditions due to poor air quality. Conversely, rural populations are likely to face health challenges stemming from changes in rainfall patterns, leading to water scarcity and increased prevalence of waterborne diseases. Additionally, rural livelihoods dependent on agriculture will be at risk from declining crop yields and food security. Addressing these disparities is crucial for developing targeted health interventions and climate adaptation strategies.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Urban populations will experience increased heat-related illnesses by 2040. | Heat spells are projected to increase, particularly exceeding thresholds of 30°C for urban areas. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Rural areas will suffer more from waterborne diseases due to increased rainfall variability. | Data indicates that rural health risks will be exacerbated by significant increase in rainfall extremes affecting water quality. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Predictions are based on CMIP6 climate models assessing high-emission scenarios (SSP5-8.5).  \n- Data limitations: Localized data may not capture all regional disparities accurately.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence due to existing climatic trends and health projections.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop and implement heat action plans in urban areas to protect vulnerable populations during heatwaves.  \n2. Enhance water infrastructure and management in rural areas to ensure clean water access and sanitation.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Urban heat islands: Areas in cities that experience higher temperatures than their rural surroundings due to human activities and infrastructure.  \n- Vulnerable populations: Groups who are at greater risk of adverse health effects due to socio-economic, environmental, or health-related factors.",
