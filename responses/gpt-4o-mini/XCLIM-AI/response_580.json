  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the broad financial risks posed by climate change to the real estate market in South Florida, USA, over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBroad financial risks to South Florida's real estate market include increased flooding, rising sea levels, extreme heat, and insurance cost volatility.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate change poses significant financial risks to South Florida's real estate sector, including increased flooding and property devaluation due to rising sea levels. With numerous heat waves projected, residents may face heightened cooling costs, affecting housing affordability. The frequency of wet and dry spells may complicate agricultural yields and impact property values. Insurance costs are expected to rise as more properties become vulnerable to climate-related risks, leading to higher premiums and potential uninsurability for some areas. As the market adapts, investors will need to consider these changing conditions and their implications on long-term asset longevity and value.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | 1126.66 mm average liquid precipitation expected annually | Annual mean precipitation trend data indicates a significant rise | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | 8.5 heat waves anticipated annually | Historical analysis shows an increase in the frequency of heat waves based on temperature data | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Increased flooding will impact property values | Economic models predict disruptions in property markets due to extreme weather events | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Climate models suggest worsening conditions, but specific projections are uncertain.  \n- Data limitations: Models may not capture localized impacts of climate change accurately.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on climate projections and economic impact analyses.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure to mitigate flooding and ensure property stability.  \n2. Advocate for comprehensive insurance reforms that incorporate climate change risk assessments.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Flooding:** The overflow of water onto typically dry land.  \n- **Heat waves:** Extended periods of excessively high temperatures.  \n- **Insurance volatility:** Fluctuations in insurance premiums based on perceived risk levels.",
