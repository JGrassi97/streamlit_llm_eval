  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat impact might expected temperature changes have on energy demand in Cairo, Egypt over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures are expected to significantly increase energy demand for cooling in Cairo, with an average increase of approximately 400 cooling degree days by 2050.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAs global temperatures rise, Cairo is projected to see a substantial increase in cooling degree days, driving up energy demand for air conditioning. From a mean of 2263 CDDs in 2020 to an expected 2655 CDDs by 2050, this trend highlights growing heating needs, particularly during hot months. Concurrently, the number of days with maximum temperatures exceeding 25°C is expected to rise, further stressing energy systems. This increase in demand poses risks for energy infrastructure, particularly during peak periods, indicating the need for strategic planning to enhance energy efficiency and capacity.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Cooling degree days are expected to increase by approximately 400 by 2050. | Current mean CDDs: 2263 (2020), projected mean CDDs: 2655 (2050). | *“CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)”* | numeric |\n| 2 | The frequency of days exceeding 25°C is increasing. | Current days exceeding 25°C: 237.7 (2020), projected: 254.31 (2050). | *“CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)”* | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projected range based on SSP5-8.5 emissions scenario.  \n- Data limitations: Model uncertainties in climate projections.  \n- Confidence statements: High, based on multi-model ensemble mean data validity.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Enhance cooling infrastructure to meet projected energy demands by investing in energy-efficient buildings and technologies.  \n2. Implement public awareness campaigns for energy conservation during peak heat events to alleviate pressure on energy systems.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Cooling degree days (CDD) measure the demand for cooling based on temperature and energy consumption patterns.  \n- Energy infrastructure includes power generation, distribution, and consumption systems necessary to meet public energy needs.",
