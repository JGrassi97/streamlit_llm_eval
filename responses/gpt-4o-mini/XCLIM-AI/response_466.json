  "QuestionText": "How could evolving climate patterns affect the development of wind and solar power in India over the next 30 years?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving climate patterns affect the development of wind and solar power in India over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nEvolving climate patterns are likely to result in decreased wind variability and altered solar irradiance, impacting the efficiency and reliability of wind and solar power generation in India.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nIn India, anticipated climate trends show a decrease in wind speed variability alongside changes in solar irradiance levels. The average annual maximum wind speed over the last 30 years has shown a slight downtrend, with projections indicating continued variability. Concurrently, solar power potential could be affected by increased frequency of extreme temperature events influencing cloud cover and sunlight availability. As such, while opportunities exist for expanding renewable energy infrastructure, the reliability of wind and solar energy generation may decline, necessitating adaptive measures in energy planning and resource allocation.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Maximum daily wind speed shows a downtrend. | Historical average maximum wind speed (33.93 m/s) has a slope of -0.02 in the last 30 years. | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)” | numeric |\n| 2 | Variability in wind patterns projected to continue. | Wind speed standard deviation remains around 4.41, indicating variability. | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)” | numeric |\n| 3 | Solar potential may decline due to temperature changes. | Average annual mean temperature indicates a growing trend affecting solar irradiance patterns. | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)” | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Multiple climate models indicate diverse projections of renewable potentials in India.  \n- Data limitations: Some data may not encapsulate localized climate effects impacting energy production.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on available data trends and projections.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in adaptive infrastructure for renewable energy that can accommodate variability in wind and solar resources.  \n2. Increase research into hybrid renewable systems to mitigate risks posed by changing climatic conditions.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Wind speed variability:** Fluctuations in wind speeds that can affect energy generation.  \n- **Solar irradiance:** The amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface, crucial for solar power generation.",
