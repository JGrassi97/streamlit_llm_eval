  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow are changing precipitation patterns expected to alter the risk profile and premiums for agricultural insurance policies covering soybean crops in Rosario, Argentina, by 2030? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nChanging precipitation patterns are likely to increase agricultural insurance premiums due to greater variability and increasing intensity of extreme weather events.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2030, altered precipitation patterns in Rosario, Argentina, characterized by an increase in average daily precipitation and heightened variability in temperature ranges, will likely result in higher risks for agricultural insurance policies covering soybean crops. The projected increase in mean precipitation from 14.58 mm to 15.53 mm underscores a trend towards heavier rainfall events, increasing the likelihood of flooding. Additionally, more significant temperature variability can lead to higher crop stress. Insurers may respond with increased premiums to adjust for the elevated risks associated with these changing climatic conditions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average daily precipitation is expected to increase from 14.58 mm to 15.53 mm. | Historical mean precipitation (1981-2020): 14.58 mm; Medium-term forecast (2036-2050): 15.53 mm. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric | \n| 2 | Daily temperature range variability suggests increases in risks associated with temperature extremes. | Variability of daily temperature range decreased from a historical mean of 2.73 to 2.68 predictively. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Climate models used assume continued high emissions under SSP5-8.5 and rely on CMIP6 model projections.  \n- Data limitations: Results reflect model predictions which may not capture localized climatic variations accurately.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence due to reliance on projections; emissions pathways could impose significant uncertainty.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Insurance companies should adjust risk assessments and premium models to reflect new precipitation and temperature data trends.  \n2. Stakeholders in agriculture should invest in adaptive practices and technologies to mitigate increased risks from climate variability.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Precipitation:** The amount of liquid water that falls to the ground, typically measured in millimeters.  \n- **Temperature variability:** The degree to which daily temperatures differ from one another over a specific period, impacting crop health and risk assessments.
