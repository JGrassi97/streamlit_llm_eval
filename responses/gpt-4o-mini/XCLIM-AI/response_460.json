  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will changing climate patterns affect the potential for renewable energy generation across the Iberian Peninsula by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nChanging climate patterns will likely enhance wind energy potential, while precipitation variability may impact hydropower generation.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, climate changes are projected to increase maximum wind speeds and alter precipitation patterns across the Iberian Peninsula. The annual mean maximum near-surface wind speed is expected to stabilize around 32.4 m/s with minor fluctuations, enhancing the viability of wind energy. Conversely, the mean daily precipitation for days exceeding 1 mm is projected to show only slight increases, with variability leading to potential risks for hydropower reliance, especially during dry spells. This dual influence—rising wind energy potential and fluctuating water availability—highlights both significant opportunities and risks for renewable energy sectors in the region.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Annual mean maximum near-surface wind speed expected around 32.4 m/s by 2040 | Historical mean of 33.0 m/s, with a projected mean of 32.4 m/s for 2036-2050 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Precipitation variability indicates risks for hydropower generation | Slight increase in precipitation averaging around 5.62 mm/day forecasted for future periods | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Predicated on assumptions of steady state within existing trends in climate models.  \n- Data limitations: Data is aggregated from projections, potential internal model variance is unaccounted.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium confidence due to variability in climate modeling and system responsiveness.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in wind energy infrastructure and technology to harness increased wind capacity.  \n2. Develop comprehensive water management strategies to adapt hydropower systems to fluctuating precipitation patterns.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Mean maximum near-surface wind speed\" refers to the average high wind speed measured near the ground level, a critical factor for wind energy generation efficiency.  \n- \"Precipitation variability\" indicates changes in the amount and timing of rainfall, which can impact water storage and usage for energy production.",
