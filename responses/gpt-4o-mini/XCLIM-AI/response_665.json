  "QuestionText": "What effects are anticipated from changes in precipitation on water infrastructure in Khartoum, Sudan by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat effects are anticipated from changes in precipitation on water infrastructure in Khartoum, Sudan by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased variability in precipitation is expected to strain Khartoum’s water infrastructure, exacerbating flood risks and affecting water supply.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, Khartoum, Sudan, is projected to experience increased rainfall variability, with average annual precipitation estimated to stabilize around 85 mm, following trends of minimal overall change. However, short- and long-term precipitation models highlight potential for extreme weather events, such as flooding, particularly with anticipated increases in mean precipitation during wetter years. These changes pose substantial risks to water infrastructure, notably increased flooding and challenges in water management. To mitigate impacts, investing in adaptive infrastructure and improved drainage systems is critical.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average annual precipitation is expected to be around 85 mm by 2040 | Average annual precipitation for medium-term (2036-2050): 85.23 mm | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Increased variability and risks of flooding are projected | Historical variability indicates a shift with a max of 363 mm; short-term max is 120 mm | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on historical trends and models predicting precipitation under high-emission scenarios.  \n- Data limitations: Data quality depends on the resolution and representativeness of regional climate models.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium confidence in precipitation trends but high uncertainty surrounding extreme weather events.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in adaptive water infrastructure and improve stormwater management systems to handle increased flooding risks.  \n2. Implement comprehensive water resource management strategies that consider changing precipitation patterns and variability.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Precipitation variability\" refers to changes in the amount and frequency of rainfall over time, affecting water availability and flood risk.  \n- \"Adaptive infrastructure\" includes systems designed to adapt to changes in climate, helping to mitigate extreme weather impacts.",
