  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow is the geographic range for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector for dengue fever, expected to change in southern Europe due to rising average winter temperatures by 2035, for example near Rome, Italy?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nThe geographic range of Aedes aegypti is expected to expand northward into southern Europe, including areas around Rome, due to warmer winter temperatures by 2035.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nRising average winter temperatures in southern Europe, particularly around Rome, are projected to expand the geographic range of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a key vector for dengue fever. By 2035, milder winters may facilitate year-round survival and breeding of this species in regions previously too cold for them. This change poses significant risks for public health, necessitating enhanced mosquito surveillance and control measures as well as public health preparedness to cope with potential outbreaks of dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Aedes aegypti's range is expanding due to rising winter temperatures. | Studies show that temperatures below 10°C limit their survival; rising winter temperatures enable their presence in areas like Rome. | N/A | text |\n| 2 | By 2035, conditions in Rome could support year-round populations of Aedes aegypti. | Climate models predict increased temperatures that will allow Aedes aegypti to breed in southern Europe. | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections assume continued warming trends under high-emission scenarios; actual temperatures may vary.  \n- Data limitations: The extent of adaptation and ecological impact on local mosquito populations is complex and can vary by region.  \n- Confidence statements: Confidence in biological responses to climate is moderate due to varying local conditions and potential ecological factors.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement mosquito surveillance programs in southern Europe to monitor and control potential Aedes aegypti populations.\n2. Develop public health education campaigns to raise awareness about dengue fever and prevention methods as the risk increases.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Aedes aegypti: A species of mosquito known to transmit diseases like dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya.\n- Geographic range: The areas where a species is found, which can change due to environmental factors like temperature.",
