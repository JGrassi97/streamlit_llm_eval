  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the primary climate-related health risks for populations in Southern California, USA, through 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nThe primary climate-related health risks include increased heat-related illnesses due to higher temperatures and humidity, leading to heatwaves and exacerbating respiratory issues from air pollution.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nIn Southern California, increasing temperatures and humidity levels projected through 2050 pose significant health risks. Humidex values indicate worsening conditions, likely leading to more frequent heat-related illnesses. The number of days with high minimum and maximum temperatures is increasing, indicating intensified heatwaves. These conditions elevate the risk of heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and respiratory complications from poor air quality. Vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, are particularly at risk. Mitigation measures such as increased green space and public health campaigns are necessary to protect these communities.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Humidity and temperature conditions are worsening | Projected mean humidex values show an increase from 19.43°C to 21.14°C by 2050 | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)” | numeric |\n| 2 | Increase in the number of days exceeding heat thresholds | Expected increase of heatwave days from historical averages with projections for 2036-2050 | “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)” | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on a high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario.  \n- Data limitations: Outcomes depend on model accuracy; local variations may affect results.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature trends, but less certainty in public health response effectiveness.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement community heat action plans that include outreach to vulnerable populations during heat events.  \n2. Increase urban green infrastructure to mitigate urban heat islands and improve air quality.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Humidex: A measurement that combines temperature and humidity to indicate perceived heat; important for understanding heat-related health risks.  \n- Vulnerable populations: Groups at greater risk, including older adults, children, and those with health conditions.",
