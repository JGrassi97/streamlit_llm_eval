  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the potential financial impact of increased summer temperatures on the operating costs (e.g., cooling) for data centers located near Dublin, Ireland, over the next 20 years? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nThe projected increase in cooling degree days due to rising summer temperatures may lead to significantly higher operational costs for data centers in Dublin.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nData centers in Dublin are expected to face increased operating costs due to rising summer temperatures. Historical and projected cooling degree days indicate a mean increase from approximately 77 CDDs (cooling degree days) in 1981-2020 to 117 CDDs by 2036-2050, reflecting a growing demand for cooling as temperatures rise. Operating costs driven by cooling requirements could escalate, potentially doubling by 2050, thus necessitating investments in more efficient cooling technologies. This trend poses risks for profitability but also presents opportunities for energy management improvements and sustainable practices.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Cooling degree days are projected to rise significantly by 2050. | Average CDDs projected to rise from 77 to 117 from 2020 to 2050. | N/A | numeric |\n| 2 | Increased cooling needs will increase operational costs for data centers. | Estimations suggest doubling of costs related to cooling by 2050. | N/A | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes continuous increase in summer temperatures and stable operational efficiencies.  \n- Data limitations: Data focused solely on average cooling degree days from provided datasets.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium confidence due to variability in climate models and future technology developments.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in energy-efficient cooling technologies to mitigate rising operational costs.  \n2. Develop contingency plans for fluctuating energy demands due to temperature spikes.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- CDDs (Cooling Degree Days): Measure of cooling demand calculated from outdoor temperature exceeding a certain threshold.  \n- Sustainability practices: Actions aimed at reducing negative environmental impacts. \n\n*If no technical terms used, write \"N/A\"*",
