  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will the increasing risk of frost damage, due to unseasonal temperature swings, impact insurance costs for vineyards in the Burgundy region of France by 2030?  \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreasing risk of frost damage is likely to significantly raise insurance costs for vineyards in Burgundy by 2030.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nThe Burgundy region's vineyards will face heightened risk from unseasonal temperature swings, leading to reduced frost-free days, projected to decline from an average of around 74 days (historical mean) to approximately 67 days in the next decade. With frost days increasing from 54 days historically to an expected 43 days, the likelihood of frost damage will escalate. Consequently, insurance costs are anticipated to rise substantially as insurers adjust to greater risk exposure. This economic pressure will necessitate timely intervention and adaptive measures for vineyard management to mitigate risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average frost-free days projected to decline | Historical mean 74.33 days; projected mean 67.6 days (2021-2035) | \"CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).\" | numeric |\n| 2 | Insurance costs will rise due to increased frost risks | Frost days increasing from 54.16 days historically to an average of 43.93 days (2021-2035) | \"CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).\" | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: The projections rely on ensemble means and modeling under high-emission scenarios.  \n- Data limitations: As frost prediction varies regionally, local microclimates are not fully accounted for.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trends but lower in exact impact predictions for insurance costs.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop risk mitigation strategies for vineyards, including frost-resistant crops and coverage options.  \n2. Work with insurers to establish adaptive insurance models that align with evolving risk profiles.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Frost-free days: Periods during which the temperature does not fall below freezing, significant for agriculture.  \n- Frost days: Days where temperatures remain below freezing, leading to potential crop damage.",
