  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat public health challenges will arise from climate change in the densely populated river deltas of Southeast Asia over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreasing heat, flooding, vector-borne diseases, and food insecurity pose major public health challenges.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate change will exacerbate public health challenges in the densely populated river deltas of Southeast Asia due to higher temperatures, increased flooding, and intensified droughts. These changes will likely lead to a rise in heat-related illnesses and vector-borne diseases while affecting water quality and food security. Vulnerable populations concentrated in coastal regions face heightened risks, with extreme weather events causing displacement and exacerbating health inequities. If not addressed, these challenges could overwhelm local healthcare systems and hinder socio-economic development.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures will lead to increased health risks. | Global surface temperatures have risen by 1.1 °C, impacting human health in tropical latitudes. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency. | Approximately 30 million people were displaced by climate events in 2020; water insecurity could affect double that by 4 °C rise. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Likely impacts under various temperature rise scenarios (e.g., 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 4 °C).  \n- Data limitations: The lack of detailed local climate impact studies hinders precise predictions.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trends of increasing temperatures and extreme weather events based on historical data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop and implement community-based health adaptation strategies focusing on extreme heat and infectious diseases.  \n2. Increase investment in climate-resilient infrastructure to mitigate flooding and improve water quality.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Climate change: Long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns due to human activity.  \n- Vector-borne diseases: Illnesses transmitted by vectors like mosquitoes, exacerbated by climate conditions.
