  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the projected impacts of climate change on the health of vulnerable populations in Northern Australia by mid-century?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is expected to significantly worsen health outcomes for vulnerable populations in Northern Australia due to increased heat stress, extreme weather events, and food and water scarcity.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy mid-century, vulnerable populations in Northern Australia are projected to experience adverse health impacts due to climate change, including a rise in heat-related illnesses, increased prevalence of vector-borne diseases, and heightened mental health issues attributed to extreme weather and resource scarcity. Key drivers include intensifying heat waves, shifting precipitation patterns leading to droughts and flooding, and increased exposure to natural hazards. These factors are likely to strain health services and exacerbate health inequities, making it crucial to implement adaptive strategies to safeguard community health.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures lead to increased heat-related illnesses. | Warmest year (2024) projected an increase of +1.60 °C since 1850. | Wikipedia [Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) | citation |\n| 2 | Extreme weather events pose risks to health. | Changes in precipitation patterns lead to intense storms, droughts, and flooding. | Wikipedia [Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Climate model projections vary widely based on emission scenarios.  \n- Data limitations: Limited quantitative data on projected health impacts specific to Northern Australia.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in projections based on observed trends and models.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop and implement heat health action plans targeting at-risk populations.  \n2. Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and health care systems to manage extreme weather impacts.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Vulnerable populations\" refers to groups at higher risk due to socioeconomic factors, including the elderly and low-income individuals.  \n- \"Heat-related illnesses\" include conditions like heat exhaustion and heatstroke, aggravated by extreme temperature increases.",
