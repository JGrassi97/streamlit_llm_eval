  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat implications do rising temperatures have on risk assessments for the agricultural insurance sector in Fez, Morocco by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures are expected to increase agricultural risks due to droughts and extreme weather events, impacting risk assessments in the agricultural insurance sector.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, rising temperatures in Fez, Morocco, are projected to lead to more frequent and intense droughts and storms, which significantly affect agricultural productivity and increase risks for agricultural insurance. Insurers may face higher premiums and potential financial losses due to these climate variations. It is paramount for the agricultural insurance sector to refine risk models to incorporate anticipated climate changes, particularly for crops such as corn (Zea mays), which has optimal growth temperatures between 18°C and 33°C. Such adjustments are essential to maintain crop viability and insurance sustainability in a changing climate.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures correlate with increased agricultural risk. | 2024 recorded a temperature increase of +1.60°C above pre-industrial levels, leading to extreme weather patterns affecting agriculture. | Wikipedia article on Climate Change | citation |\n| 2 | The optimal temperature range for corn is critical for its growth. | Optimal temperatures for growth are 18°C to 33°C, exceeding these could affect yields negatively. | ECOCROP database | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: The potential for unanticipated increases in extreme weather events and local adaptation responses.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium confidence due to variability in climate modeling outcomes.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Revise agricultural insurance risk models to factor in rising temperature scenarios and extreme weather events.  \n2. Consider implementing crop diversification strategies among insured farmers to mitigate risk related to temperature increases.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Agricultural insurance sector: Companies that provide financial protection to farmers against potential losses in crop yields caused by adverse weather conditions.  \n- ECOCROP database: A database that provides information on environmental requirements for crops to aid in agricultural planning and insurance assessments.",
