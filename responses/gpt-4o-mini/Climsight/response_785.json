  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving wind patterns affect financial risk planning in Oujda, Morocco during 2020-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nEvolving wind patterns may increase financial risks related to energy production and agriculture while requiring adaptive risk management strategies.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nChanges in wind patterns from 2020 to 2050 in Oujda indicate fluctuating u-wind and v-wind speeds, which can impact energy production, especially wind energy projects. The monthly mean u-wind is projected to vary from 1.22 m/s in January 2020-2029 to decreasing patterns in the future, while v-wind speeds may drop significantly, especially in summer months. Additionally, varying precipitation patterns could exacerbate risks associated with agricultural activities, emphasizing the need for comprehensive financial risk planning focused on adapting to these evolving conditions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Evolving wind patterns may affect energy production. | U-wind speeds fluctuate, maximum of 1.34 m/s in March, decreasing after 2030. | N/A | numeric |\n| 2 | Variability in precipitation could impact agriculture. | Monthly mean precipitation is projected to fluctuate from 47.48 mm in May 2020-2029 to 29.93 mm in 2040-2049. | N/A | numeric | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Varying wind patterns and precipitation predicted from 2020 to 2050.  \n- Data limitations: Limited economic models specifically linking wind patterns to financial risks.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium confidence in data reflecting true future conditions.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement adaptive financial risk management strategies in energy and agricultural sectors.  \n2. Regularly update risk assessments based on evolving wind and precipitation data to inform decision-making.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- U-wind: The east-west component of wind speed.  \n- V-wind: The north-south component of wind speed.  \n- Precipitation: The amount of rain recorded, critical for agriculture and water resources.",
