Additionally, the diminished water supply can erode investor confidence in the long-term viability of these bonds, creating further financial pressures.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Reduced water allocations strain municipal budgets. | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| 2 | Drought affects investor confidence in city bonds. | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: Lack of specific quantitative data on bond market impacts due to drought.   \n- Confidence statements: N/A\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1.
