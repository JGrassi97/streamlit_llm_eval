  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of rising temperatures on the financial viability of cattle farming operations in Queensland, Australia, due to increased costs for water and feed by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures are expected to negatively impact the financial viability of cattle farming in Queensland by increasing water and feed costs.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, average temperatures in Queensland are projected to increase, reaching up to 30.11°C in March, with drought conditions potentially leading to reduced water availability. Precipitation levels may be variable, with expected rainfall of 102.0 mm in January and potentially as low as 1.81 mm in September. This combination of higher temperatures and erratic rainfall is likely to curb available resources for cattle farming while simultaneously inflating costs associated with water and feed management. Such environmental shifts could jeopardize the economic sustainability of cattle farming operations in the region, necessitating adaptive measures.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures increase cattle farming costs | Projected temperatures: March 2040: 30.11°C | ClimSight Data | numeric | \n| 2 | Variable precipitation affects resources | January 2040: 102.0 mm, September 2040: 1.81 mm | ClimSight Data | numeric | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections until 2040 based on existing climate models.  \n- Data limitations: General temperature and precipitation data may not fully capture specific cattle farming dynamics.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in projected temperature increase and precipitation variability based on current climate models.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in water-saving irrigation technology to mitigate increased costs.  \n2. Diversify feed sources to build resilience against fluctuating prices and availability.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Cattle farming\": refers to the breeding and raising of cattle primarily for meat production.  \n- \"Irrigation technology\": methods to supply water to crops efficiently, reducing water usage in farming.
