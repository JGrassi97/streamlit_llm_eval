  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow is the geographic range for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector for dengue fever, expected to change in southern Europe due to rising average winter temperatures by 2035, for example near Rome, Italy?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nThe geographic range of Aedes aegypti is expected to expand in southern Europe, particularly around Rome, owing to rising average winter temperatures by 2035.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAverage winter temperatures in Rome are projected to rise from 7.88°C in January 2030 to 9.44°C by 2040. This increase creates a more hospitable environment for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which thrive in warmer conditions and require specific moisture levels for breeding. The resulting milder winters can lead to expanded habitats for these mosquitoes, significantly raising the risk of dengue outbreaks. Public health initiatives in the region may need to adapt to address this growing threat, emphasizing the importance of mosquito monitoring and vector control strategies.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average winter temperatures are rising. | January average temperature projected to be 7.88°C in 2030 and 9.44°C in 2040. | XCLIM analysis | numeric | \n| 2 | Aedes aegypti thrives in warmer conditions. | Aedes aegypti prefers warm climates; habitat expansion occurs in warmer areas. | Wikipedia | citation | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future temperature and precipitation changes based on historical trends in Rome.  \n- Data limitations: No specific projections available for Aedes aegypti range; focus on temperature and precipitation as key factors.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in predictions linking climate change and mosquito proliferation, supported by ecological research.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement enhanced vector control measures to reduce Aedes aegypti populations and minimize dengue risk as temperatures rise.  \n2. Foster public awareness campaigns aimed at educating residents about preventive measures against mosquito breeding and dengue fever transmission.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Aedes aegypti is a mosquito species known for transmitting diseases like dengue fever, thriving in warmer climates.  \n- The geographic range refers to areas suitable for the species to live and reproduce, which is influenced by temperature and water availability for breeding.",
