  "QuestionText": "How will changing climate patterns affect the potential for renewable energy generation across the Iberian Peninsula by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will changing climate patterns affect the potential for renewable energy generation across the Iberian Peninsula by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nChanging climate patterns will likely decrease hydropower potential due to decreased precipitation while affecting wind and solar energy generation variably across the Iberian Peninsula by 2040.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, the Iberian Peninsula is projected to experience increased temperatures, decreased precipitation, and variable wind patterns. Monthly mean temperatures are expected to rise significantly, with values averaging 22.63 °C in July and 26.72 °C in August. Precipitation is anticipated to decrease sharply in summer months, posing risks to hydropower generation while potential shifts in wind speeds may affect wind energy outputs. Increased heatwaves and extreme weather events may also impact energy infrastructure resilience. Adaptation strategies in energy planning will be essential to harness prevailing climate conditions effectively.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Projected average temperature rises significantly by 2040 | Monthly mean temperature is projected to reach up to 22.63 °C in July and 26.72 °C in August | XCLIM AI report | numeric |\n| 2 | Decrease in precipitation by 2040 will hinder hydropower | Monthly mean precipitation expected to fall to approx. 3.06 mm in August | XCLIM AI report | numeric |\n| 3 | Wind speed variability may impact energy output | U-wind and V-wind values indicate fluctuations across years | XCLIM AI report | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate scenarios used.  \n- Data limitations: Projections are based on climate models with inherent uncertainties, and localized effects may vary.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence (due to model variability).\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in diversified renewable energy systems to buffer against changes in hydropower.  \n2. Implement advanced monitoring for wind patterns to optimize energy generation strategies.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"RCP\" refers to Representative Concentration Pathways used in climate modeling to speculate about greenhouse gas concentration trajectories.  \n- \"U-wind\" and \"V-wind\" are components of wind speed and direction that provide valuable data on wind energy delivery.",
