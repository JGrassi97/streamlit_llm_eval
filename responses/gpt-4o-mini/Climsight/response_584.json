  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the expected financial risks to supply chains originating from manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia due to climate change?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFinancial risks to supply chains in Southeast Asia due to climate change include increased investment costs, supply disruptions, and reduced agricultural productivity.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nManufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia face significant financial risks from climate change, including extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and changing precipitation patterns that lead to supply chain disruptions. Increasing temperatures jeopardize agricultural productivity and labor availability, while extreme weather events like flooding and drought damage infrastructure and logistics. Competition for limited water resources intensifies these issues, driving up operational costs. Companies must proactively invest in adaptive infrastructure and diversified supply chains to mitigate climate-related risks and safeguard their operations against these emerging uncertainties.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures may lead to significant health risks and reduced agricultural productivity. | A study projects temperature increases comparable to the hottest parts of the Sahara within 50 years. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Extreme weather events are increasing, impacting supply chains through infrastructure damage. | Climate change is forecasted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: Limited specific precipitation and temperature data for precise forecasting.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence based on prevailing climate models and historical data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events.  \n2. Diversify supply chain sources to reduce reliance on vulnerable regions.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Adaptive infrastructure\" refers to buildings and systems designed to withstand changing climate conditions.  \n- \"Climate-resilient\" means the ability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from climate-related hazards.",
