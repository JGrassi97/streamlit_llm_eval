  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving precipitation patterns from 2020 to 2040 disrupt renewable energy supplies in Oran, Algeria?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nShifts in precipitation patterns will likely reduce water levels for hydropower and affect solar panel efficiency due to increased dust and rainfall.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBetween 2020 and 2040, Oran is expected to experience decreased annual precipitation, particularly during critical months for hydropower generation, with average monthly values dropping from 44.48 mm to 33.3 mm in January and further reductions in July and August. These changes could hinder renewable energy supplies, particularly hydropower, which requires reliable water sources. Additionally, rising temperatures may exacerbate the efficiency of solar panels during extreme weather events. Overall, the region faces risks in renewable energy production, necessitating adaptive strategies to maintain energy reliability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Precipitation in Oran is decreasing over the years. | January precipitation is projected to drop from 44.48 mm in 2020-2029 to 33.3 mm in 2030-2039. | Climatic data | numeric |\n| 2 | Rising temperatures may affect solar panel efficiency. | Average temperature is rising, with August projected to reach 29.18 °C by 2040-2049. | Climatic data | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections based on climate models for Oran from 2020 to 2040.  \n- Data limitations: Data based on climatic models and historical averages; localized variations may exist.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence due to reliance on predictive models.  \n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in alternative energy solutions that are less dependent on hydropower to ensure energy stability.  \n2. Implement dust management practices for solar facilities to maintain efficiency during fluctuating weather conditions.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Renewable energy** refers to energy sourced from natural processes that are continuously replenished, such as solar and hydroelectric power.  \n- **Hydropower** is energy generated from water flow, usually by dams or turbines connected to water sources.",
