  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will future climate conditions impact the mix of renewable energy sources in Germany by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFuture climate conditions will likely enhance the potential of renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar, while also posing challenges due to variability in weather patterns.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, Germany's renewable energy sector is projected to experience transformative changes due to climate conditions, with opportunities arising from increasing temperatures favorable for solar power generation. Moreover, wind energy might see enhanced capacity with alterations in wind patterns. However, the variability in precipitation and the increased frequency of extreme weather events pose risks to the reliability of energy generation. Adapting infrastructure and policy frameworks will be essential to harness these opportunities and mitigate challenges effectively in the evolving climate landscape.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased temperature will enhance solar energy prospects. | Quantitative projections indicate higher operational efficiency for solar panels in warmer conditions. | N/A | N/A |\n| 2 | Wind energy generation may be affected by changing wind patterns. | Analysis suggests variability in wind could hinder efficiency despite increased capacity. | N/A | N/A |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future climate models predict both increased temperature and variable precipitation trends that could affect energy production reliability.  \n- Data limitations: The specifics around exact quantitative impacts are currently unavailable, and further research is needed to refine projections.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on trends observed in climate data and renewable energy outputs.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in adaptive energy strategies that enhance storage solutions to balance variability in renewable energy outputs.  \n2. Develop comprehensive monitoring systems that track weather patterns to inform and optimize energy generation operations.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Renewable energy refers to sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric that do not deplete over time.  \n- Variability in energy refers to the inconsistency in generation due to changing weather patterns, which can affect supply and demand balance.",
