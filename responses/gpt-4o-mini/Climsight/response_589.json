  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow do projected climate shifts alter the risk profile for investors in the global coffee market over the next 20 years?  \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected climate shifts, including rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, exacerbate risks for coffee investors, potentially impacting yield and quality.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next two decades, projected climate shifts threaten coffee production in significant ways. Rising temperatures, expected to reach highs of 29.49°C by 2040-2049, could exceed optimal growing conditions for **Coffea arabica**, which thrives in a temperature range of 14-28°C. Moreover, anticipated changes in precipitation patterns—with potential monthly lows of 5.49 mm and significant variance—pose risks to coffee yield and quality. These factors could drive increased financial instability in the coffee market, despite potential opportunities for adaptation through innovative agricultural practices and the development of climate-resilient coffee varieties.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Expected temperature rise may exceed optimal growth conditions for coffee. | Temperatures projected to reach 29.49°C by 2040-2049. | Climatic dataset analysis | numeric | \n| 2 | Altered precipitation patterns could affect coffee yield. | Precipitation could decrease to 5.49 mm in January by 2040-2049. | Climatic dataset analysis | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Predictions assume continued trends in climate change.  \n- Data limitations: Local variability and exceptional weather events may not be captured.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence based on current climatic models.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in research for climate-resilient coffee varieties to mitigate yield risks.  \n2. Implement water conservation strategies and sustainable farming practices to manage altered precipitation patterns.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Climate shift refers to long-term alterations in temperature and precipitation affecting agriculture.  \n- **Coffea arabica** is the primary coffee species grown commercially, sensitive to climate conditions.",
