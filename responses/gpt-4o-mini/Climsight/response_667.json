  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat role will future climate variability play in affecting the resilience of coastal energy infrastructure in Tunis, Tunisia in the coming decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFuture climate variability will significantly threaten the resilience of coastal energy infrastructure in Tunis due to rising temperatures, increased extreme weather events, and sea level rise.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nCoastal energy infrastructure in Tunis faces considerable risks from future climate variability, including rising temperatures, which have increased by about 1°C over the last century in Africa. Extreme weather events are expected to become more frequent and intense, exacerbating infrastructure vulnerability. Sea level rise poses further challenges, potentially displacing communities and increasing operational risks. The main opportunities may lie in adopting adaptive measures, but the overall outlook remains precarious as climate conditions worsen.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures threaten coastal energy infrastructure. | Africa's temperature has increased by roughly 1°C since the late 19th century. | Wikipedia: Climate Change in Africa | citation |\n| 2 | Increased frequency of extreme weather events. | Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of severe weather conditions. | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: Future predictions about specific infrastructure impacts lack granularity.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature and precipitation trends; lower confidence in the exact impact on specific energy infrastructures.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement adaptive design and upgrading measures for coastal energy infrastructures to withstand extreme weather.  \n2. Monitor climate trends continuously to inform policy and planning at local government levels.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Adaptive measures\": Strategies to improve infrastructure resilience against climate change impacts.  \n- \"Sea level rise\": Increase in ocean levels due to climate change, impacting coastal areas.
