  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate variability impact sovereign credit risk for nations heavily dependent on agriculture in Central America by 2040? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate variability could significantly increase sovereign credit risk in Central America by negatively impacting agricultural productivity and economic stability.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate variability poses increased risks to agricultural productivity in Central America, a region heavily reliant on farming for economic stability. By 2040, anticipated changes, including higher temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, could further threaten crucial crops like maize, requiring rainfall between 800 to 1250 mm and temperatures between 17°C and 28°C for optimal yields. Shortfalls in agricultural production could lead to reduced GDP growth, elevated food insecurity, and heightened sovereign credit risks, potentially causing challenges in debt repayment. Addressing these issues through adaptive strategies becomes essential for mitigating future financial vulnerabilities.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Climate variability increases agricultural risks and affects sovereign credit. | Optimal rainfall for crops is 800-1250 mm with temperature between 17°C and 28°C. | N/A | numeric | \n| 2 | Significant crop requirements indicate vulnerability to climate changes. | Maize's susceptibility to temperature and rainfall variability is critical for economic health. | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future climate projections remain uncertain regarding specific changes in precipitation and temperature.  \n- Data limitations: Limited specific data on regional agricultural responses and economic impacts.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium confidence due to variability in climate models and socio-economic responses.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement adaptive agricultural practices to enhance resilience to climate variability.  \n2. Develop financial mechanisms to mitigate climate-related risks for agricultural sectors.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Sovereign credit risk\": The risk that a government will default on its debt obligations, often influenced by economic stability, which is affected by agricultural productivity under climate variability.  \n- \"Climate variability\": Fluctuations in climate patterns, including changes in temperature and precipitation, which can affect agricultural performance and economic viability.",
