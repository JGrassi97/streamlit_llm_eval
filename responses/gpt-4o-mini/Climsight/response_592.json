  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will an increase in the frequency of intense rainfall events affect flood insurance premiums for residential properties in Houston, Texas, by 2035? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nAn increase in intense rainfall events will likely result in higher flood insurance premiums for residential properties in Houston by 2035.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nThe increasing frequency and intensity of rainfall in Houston is expected to elevate flooding risks, leading to higher insurance premiums for residential properties. As intense rainfall events contribute to more frequent flood occurrences, insurance providers will adjust their pricing structures to reflect the rising risk, resulting in increased premiums for homeowners. This trend is exacerbated by the population density in flood-prone areas, making more properties susceptible to damage, which investors and insurers must consider in their risk assessments up to 2035.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type |  \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|  \n| 1 | Increased rainfall will raise flood insurance premiums | The frequency and intensity of rainfall events are linked to rising flood risks, necessitating adjustments in flood insurance policies | N/A | text |  \n| 2 | Flood risk is correlated with property elevation and population density | Properties in flood-prone areas see heightened demand for flood insurance due to increasing flood risk | N/A | text |  \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Changes in climate patterns lead to higher incidents of intense rainfall by 2035.  \n- Data limitations: Specific historical flood insurance premium data for Houston not explicitly retrieved.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium confidence based on historical trends of rainfall intensity and flood risk assessments.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Encourage homeowners to invest in flood resilience measures to mitigate risks and potential premium increases.\n2. Advocate for policy reforms that address increased insurance costs associated with rising flood risks, ensuring equitable access to flood insurance.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Flood insurance premiums**: Costs that homeowners pay to insure their properties against flood damage.\n- **Intense rainfall events**: Occurrences of heavy rain that exceed normal levels, often leading to flooding.
