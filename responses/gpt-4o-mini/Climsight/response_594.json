  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might a shorter, warmer winter affect the business interruption insurance claims for ski resorts in the French Alps over the next decade? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nA shorter, warmer winter could lead to increased business interruption insurance claims due to reduced snowfall and poorer ski conditions.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nThe French Alps are projected to experience warmer winter temperatures, significantly impacting snow cover and skiing conditions. Data indicates that the average temperature in December could rise from -1.38°C (2020-2029) to -0.42°C (2040-2049), leading to variable snow quality and reduced natural snowfall. Furthermore, precipitation patterns may become less predictable, with January precipitation potentially increasing but not guaranteeing consistent snow. This scenario poses a heightened financial risk for ski resorts, resulting in more business interruption insurance claims due to shorter operating seasons and inadequate snow conditions, necessitating supplementary investments in snowmaking technologies.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Winter temperatures are expected to increase, impacting snow cover. | December temperatures rising from -1.38°C (2020-2029) to -0.42°C (2040-2049). | ClimSight Data | numeric | \n| 2 | Increased precipitation variability could affect snowfall consistency. | January precipitation predicted to change from 153.49 mm (2020-2029) to 260.56 mm (2030-2039). | ClimSight Data | numeric | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projection of temperature and precipitation is subject to variability based on climate models.  \n- Data limitations: The modeling may not capture all environmental variables that influence snowfall and business operations.  \n- Confidence statements: Confidence in trends is moderate, given the complexities of climate factors.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Ski resorts should enhance snowmaking capabilities to compensate for reduced natural snowfall during warmer winters.  \n2. Insurance providers and ski resorts need to collaboratively revise business interruption insurance policies to accurately reflect the evolving risk landscape due to climate change.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Business interruption insurance: This insurance compensates businesses for income lost when operations are disrupted, such as from inadequate ski conditions.  \n- Snowmaking: This process involves creating artificial snow, which is crucial when natural snow levels are insufficient for ski operations.",
