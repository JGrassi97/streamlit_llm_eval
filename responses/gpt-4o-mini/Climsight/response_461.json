  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected impact of climate change on energy infrastructure resilience in coastal Louisiana, USA, over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change will likely increase temperatures, alter precipitation patterns, and intensify weather events, jeopardizing energy infrastructure resilience in coastal Louisiana.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next two decades, coastal Louisiana's energy infrastructure is projected to face significant challenges due to climate change. Average temperatures are expected to rise, with maximum August temperatures potentially reaching 37.56°C by 2049. Concurrently, precipitation patterns will shift, leading to potential flooding during critical months, thereby increasing infrastructure risks. Additionally, changing wind patterns could further exacerbate infrastructure vulnerability. These climate-induced stressors collectively threaten the stability and reliability of the region's energy systems, necessitating urgent adaptations and resilience-building measures.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures will challenge energy infrastructure resilience. | Average maximum temperatures could reach 37.56°C by 2049 in August. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Shifting precipitation patterns will increase flood risks. | Monthly data forecast significant decreases in average precipitation, leading to potential flooding. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections for 2020-2049 indicate significant climate shifts.  \n- Data limitations: Regional modeling may not fully account for extreme weather event frequency.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in temperature and precipitation trends, but uncertainty remains for localized impacts.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure upgrades to withstand increased flooding and temperature spikes.  \n2. Develop comprehensive emergency response plans tailored to the anticipated climate risks specific to coastal regions.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Climate resilience\" refers to the ability of infrastructure to withstand and adapt to climate-related stressors.  \n- \"Precipitation patterns\" denote variations in rainfall and storm events that could affect infrastructure stability.",
