  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might projected climate changes alter insurance risk assessments in Rabat, Morocco over the next three decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns will likely heighten the risk of droughts and floods, affecting insurance risk assessments significantly.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected climate changes in Rabat indicate rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation, with average summer temperatures increasing to 32.87 °C by 2040-2049 and precipitation declining significantly. These changes elevate the risks of droughts and floods, which could lead to higher claims in the agriculture and property sectors. The potential economic contractions, evidenced by a 7% GDP drop due to drought in 2020, disrupt financial stability, impacting insurance pricing and risk models. Insurers must adapt by reassessing risks based on evolving climate dynamics, potentially resulting in higher premiums and exclusion of high-risk areas.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures are projected for Rabat. | Average temperatures are expected to range from 31.26 °C in 2030-2039 to 32.87 °C in 2040-2049. | Calculated climate data | Numeric |\n| 2 | Decreased precipitation is expected. | Monthly precipitation for Rabat is projected to decline significantly, such as from average 13.9 mm in June 2020-2029 to 1.28 mm in August 2030-2039. | Calculated climate data | Numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Long-term climate model simulations indicate variability; regional climate models may differ.  \n- Data limitations: Climate data is based on projections and may not account for localized anomalies.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate level of confidence based on observed climate trends.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Insurers should integrate climate risk assessments into their underwriting processes to adapt to changing environmental conditions.  \n2. Development of dynamic pricing models reflecting climate risk factors will provide a more accurate evaluation of potential claims.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Climate risk assessments: Evaluations made to identify potential risks associated with changing climatic conditions and their impacts on insurance.  \n- Underwriting: The process of evaluating risk and determining the premium an insured must pay.",
