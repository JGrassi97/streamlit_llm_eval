  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate change influence the burden of disease in Central Asian nations over the next 20 to 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change may significantly increase the burden of disease in Central Asia, especially through heat-related illnesses and water-borne diseases.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nRising temperatures and decreased precipitation in Central Asia are projected to intensify health risks over the next few decades. Higher frequencies of heatwaves could increase heat-related illnesses, while worsening drought conditions may diminish freshwater availability, exacerbating the spread of water-borne diseases. Increased frequency of natural hazards, such as dust storms, further contribute to respiratory problems. These changes highlight the urgent need for adaptive public health strategies to manage the evolving disease burden.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increasing temperatures will lead to more heat-related illnesses. | Heatwaves in Central Asia have increased in frequency and severity. | Wikipedia URL: [Climate Change in Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Asia) | citation | \n| 2 | Water availability issues will elevate water-borne diseases. | Decreased overall rainfall is forecasted, increasing drought likelihood. | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections for heat and water stress over the next 20-30 years are based on current climate models.  \n- Data limitations: Limited long-term health data specifically for Central Asia may affect accuracy.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium confidence in predicted climate impacts on health based on available historical data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop heat-health action plans to mitigate the impact of temperature rises on vulnerable populations.  \n2. Invest in water management systems to enhance freshwater availability and reduce water-borne disease risks.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Heat-related illnesses refer to health problems arising from excessive temperatures, such as heatstroke.  \n- Water-borne diseases are illnesses caused by pathogens in contaminated water and can increase with poor water supply.
