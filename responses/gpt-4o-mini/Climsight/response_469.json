  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat changes to energy infrastructure will be needed in the Nordic countries to adapt to new climate realities over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nThe Nordic countries will need to fortify energy infrastructure against increased temperature and extreme weather events.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nTo adapt to climate change, Nordic countries must enhance their energy infrastructure to withstand rising temperatures and extreme weather events. Key drivers include increased frequency of heat waves, stronger storms, and altered precipitation patterns. The average temperature is projected to increase significantly, with 2024 recorded as the warmest year at +1.60 °C since 1850. Opportunities lie in investing in resilient renewable energy sources and upgrading grid systems to accommodate greater variability in energy supply and demand. Risks include the potential for infrastructure failures and increased energy costs if adaptation measures are not implemented efficiently.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased temperatures necessitate infrastructure upgrades. | 2024 was recorded as the warmest year at +1.60 °C since 1850. | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) | citation | \n| 2 | Climate change has resulted in more frequent extreme weather events. | Changes in climate lead to altered precipitation patterns, causing extreme weather incidents. | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: Limited data on specific energy infrastructure vulnerabilities.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence due to variability in climate projections.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in renewable energy technology and infrastructure resiliency upgrades.  \n2. Enhance grid management systems to handle increased variability in energy supply and demand.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Energy infrastructure refers to the systems and portals required for the production, transmission, and distribution of energy.  \n- Extreme weather events include phenomena such as storms, floods, and heat waves that disrupt normal operations and pose risks to infrastructure.",
