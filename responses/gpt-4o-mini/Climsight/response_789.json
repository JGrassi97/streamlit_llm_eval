  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will climate change affect the long-term risk projections for infrastructure investments in Agadir, Morocco by 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change will significantly increase the risks related to infrastructure investments in Agadir due to heightened temperatures and exacerbated drought conditions.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2050, Agadir may experience maximum temperatures approaching 50 degrees Celsius, which poses critical risks to infrastructure durability. The region will likely encounter increased frequencies of drought and extreme weather events, threatening both urban and agricultural land, and necessitating substantial investments in climate-resilient infrastructure. These challenges, exacerbated by shifting precipitation patterns leading to water scarcity, may impact economic and social stability. While innovative solutions represent significant opportunities, the high risks to existing infrastructure and urban planning frameworks remain a pressing concern.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Maximum temperatures could reach nearly 50 degrees Celsius | Literature indicates severe temperature increases in MENA; average max past 30 years was 43°C. | Wikipedia | citation |\n| 2 | Increased drought frequencies are a significant risk | Climate change analyses highlight the region's vulnerability to drought and extreme weather conditions. | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on climate models that can vary; specific statistics for Agadir are less consolidated.  \n- Data limitations: Limited historical data related to specific infrastructure investments in the region restricts predictive capability.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate; trends are notable, but local impacts may differ.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in developing climate-resilient infrastructure to withstand extreme temperatures and prolonged drought conditions.  \n2. Formulate comprehensive water management strategies to address challenges related to water scarcity affecting urban growth and agricultural needs.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Climate-resilient infrastructure\" refers to structures and facilities designed to endure various climate-related stresses, ensuring functional integrity during extreme weather events.  \n- \"Urban growth\" includes the expansion and development of urban areas, which are vulnerable to environmental impacts caused by climate change, necessitating strategic planning and investment.",
