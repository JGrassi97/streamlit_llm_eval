  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the forecasts for the viability of renewable energy infrastructure in coastal regions of Australia given climate projections for 2040-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRenewable energy infrastructure in Australia's coastal regions is likely to face increased risks from rising temperatures and more severe weather events projected for 2040-2050.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nForecasts indicate a significant rise in average temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, which will pose challenges for renewable energy infrastructure in Australia's coastal areas. The increasing intensity of heat waves, storms, and rising sea levels may threaten the reliability and resilience of such infrastructures. Opportunities exist in adapting technology for harsher climates; however, the exposure to extreme weather necessitates proactive strategies in design and implementation. Understanding the regional climate impacts will be critical in ensuring the sustainability of renewable energy investments.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures will affect renewable infrastructure viability. | Average global temperature is projected to rise by +1.60 °C by 2040 relative to pre-industrial levels. | Wikipedia URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Australia | citation |\n| 2 | Increased storm intensity poses a risk to infrastructure. | Climate change is leading to more intense storms and extreme weather events in coastal regions. | Wikipedia URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections for 2040-2050 are based on global climate models predicting significant warming and variability of weather.  \n- Data limitations: Regional projections may differ due to local factors not fully incorporated into the models.  \n- Confidence statements: Current assessments yield moderate confidence in future climate impacts based on observed trends.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in resilient renewable energy designs to withstand increased heat and severe weather.  \n2. Develop adaptive strategies for infrastructure maintenance to address changing climate conditions.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Renewable energy infrastructure refers to facilities and technologies that produce energy from renewable sources such as solar and wind.  \n- Projections are based on underlying climate models that forecast temperature and precipitation changes over time.",
