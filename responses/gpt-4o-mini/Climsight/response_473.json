  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected change in solar panel energy output during summer months in Seville, Spain, due to higher average temperatures between 2030 and 2040? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nHigher average temperatures between 2030 and 2040 are likely to decrease solar panel efficiency in Seville, affecting overall energy output negatively.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nIn Seville, projected increases in summer average temperatures from 2030 to 2040 will likely reduce the efficiency of solar panels, which typically experience performance degradation at higher temperatures. For every degree Celsius of temperature increase, photovoltaic systems generally see their efficiency decline; however, quantitative projections for energy output specific to this timeframe are lacking. As such, careful monitoring and adaptation in solar panel technology may be required to sustain energy production in these increasingly warm conditions, marking a critical area for further research and infrastructure planning.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Higher temperatures generally reduce solar panel efficiency. | The performance of photovoltaic modules decreases with increased temperature. | Wikipedia: Solar panel performance | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future predictions about specific temperature impacts are not available.  \n- Data limitations: Lack of concrete projections for energy output based on temperature changes.  \n- Confidence statements: Confidence in the general trend of decreased efficiency with temperature increase but uncertain quantification for future outputs.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Conduct targeted studies to assess how projected temperature increases specifically influence solar panel efficiency in Seville.  \n2. Explore installation designs that can mitigate temperature effects to maintain efficient solar energy capture.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Photovoltaic systems are devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity.  \n- Temperature coefficients are measures that define how the efficiency of solar panels varies with temperature.",
