  "QuestionText": "How could evolving climate patterns affect the development of wind and solar power in India over the next 30 years?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving climate patterns affect the development of wind and solar power in India over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is likely to impact wind and solar energy development in India due to changes in temperature, wind patterns, and precipitation.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next 30 years, evolving climate patterns in India may significantly affect wind and solar power development. Rising average temperatures, which could reach an increase of 1.63 °C by 2049, may reduce the efficiency of solar panels as they struggle to operate optimally at higher temperatures. Moreover, altered precipitation patterns could hinder both solar and wind generation, with significant variability in monsoonal rainfall potentially leading to reduced generation capacity. Additionally, shifting wind patterns are forecasted to impact wind resource availability favorably in some months while negatively in others. The need for adaptable energy infrastructure and enhanced technology is crucial to mitigate these impacts.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures may degrade solar panel efficiency. | Global warming projections indicate an increase of 1.63 °C by 2049. | Wikipedia [Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) | citation |\n| 2 | Altered precipitation patterns may affect energy generation. | Increased monsoonal variability in India influencing solar and wind generation. | Wikipedia [Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) | citation | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future climate projections based on current trends and historical models.  \n- Data limitations: Limited local real-time data affecting specific impacts on solar and wind efficiency.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on general climate trends and projections.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in technology that enhances solar panel efficiency at higher temperatures, including cooling systems or materials that better withstand heat.  \n2. Develop infrastructure that is resilient to extreme weather events, ensuring that energy generation can withstand variability caused by changing climate patterns.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Solar panel efficiency**: The effectiveness of solar panels can decline at elevated temperatures exceeding optimal ranges, which may be reached with rising global temperatures.  \n- **Precipitation patterns**: Variability in rainfall can affect solar generation through increased cloud cover and can influence wind patterns, impacting the reliability of wind energy.",
