  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the potential financial impact of increased summer temperatures on the operating costs (e.g., cooling) for data centers located near Dublin, Ireland, over the next 20 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased summer temperatures are projected to elevate cooling costs for data centers in Dublin significantly over the next 20 years.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAs Dublin experiences rising summer temperatures—with July averages increasing from 14.28°C in 2020-2029 to 14.85°C in 2040-2049—the operational costs for data centers will likely grow due to heightened cooling demands. The projected mean precipitation levels show slight variability, which may also influence cooling efficiency. Data centers will face increasing financial pressure from energy costs associated with cooling, potentially leading to substantial increases in operating expenses. Companies should prepare for these financial shifts while considering investments in energy-efficient cooling technologies to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising summer temperatures will increase cooling costs. | July average temperature increases from 14.28°C (2020-2029) to 14.85°C (2040-2049). | ClimSight Data | Numeric | \n| 2 | Slight variability in precipitation can influence cooling efficiency. | June and July precipitation averages (59.29 mm and 55.86 mm) show little change from 2020-2029 to 2030-2039. | ClimSight Data | Numeric | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Estimated climate changes over 20 years.  \n- Data limitations: Projections depend on climate models that may change based on global emissions.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence due to reliance on climate models and historical data trends.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in energy-efficient cooling systems to mitigate rising operational costs.  \n2. Implement a comprehensive strategy for energy management to optimize cooling operations.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Cooling costs\" refer to the expenses associated with maintaining optimal temperatures in data centers, primarily through air conditioning and other climate control systems. \n- \"Climate models\" are tools used to predict future climate conditions based on various scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions.",
