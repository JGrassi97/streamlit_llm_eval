  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat influence will projected temperature changes have on solar panel efficiency in the Sahara region, Algeria by 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected temperature increases in the Sahara region will likely decrease solar panel efficiency due to higher operational temperatures.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAs temperatures in the Sahara are expected to rise significantly by 2050, the efficiency of solar panels, particularly silicon-based ones, will likely decline. A temperature increase of approximately 1 °C can reduce solar panel efficiency by about 0.45%. With projected temperatures reaching around 45 °C, this could potentially yield drops in energy output and reliability. Therefore, while the Sahara offers abundant sunlight for solar energy production, high temperatures may present significant risks to the viability and performance of solar installations, necessitating adaptations to technology and operational strategies.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | An increase in temperature reduces solar panel efficiency. | 1 °C increase leads to efficiency decrease of about 0.45%. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | High temperatures impact solar panel voltage. | High-quality solar cells show a VOC decrease from 0.60 V at 25 °C to 0.55 V at 45 °C. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Not directly available; varies based on climate models for the region.  \n- Data limitations: Lack of specific quantitative data on projected changes in solar irradiance or localized effects.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in the temperature efficiency relationship based on existing knowledge.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in temperature-resistant solar technologies that maintain efficiency in extreme heat.  \n2. Implement monitoring systems to track performance changes and adjust operational strategies accordingly.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Solar panel efficiency** refers to the percentage of sunlight that can be converted into usable electricity, which is affected by temperature among other environmental factors.  \n- **VOC (Open-Circuit Voltage)** is a key performance metric for solar cells indicating the maximum voltage produced.",
