  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the expected financial risks to supply chains originating from manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia due to climate change?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFinancial risks include disruptions from extreme weather, increased operational costs, and shifts in global demand.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nManufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia are vulnerable to climate change, leading to significant financial risks. Extreme weather events, such as flooding and typhoons, can disrupt transportation and production, resulting in increased costs and delays. Additionally, rising sea levels threaten coastal facilities, necessitating costly adaptations or relocations. Supply chain resilience may be challenged as global demand shifts toward more sustainable practices, affecting product lifecycle costs and market dynamics. Proactively addressing these risks can provide opportunities for innovation and competitiveness in a changing landscape.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Extreme weather increases supply chain disruptions. | N/A | N/A | text | \n| 2 | Rising sea levels threaten coastal manufacturing facilities. | N/A | N/A | text | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: Lack of specific quantitative data on financial impacts  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on general trends in climate change impacts\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement risk assessment frameworks to evaluate and prioritize climate vulnerabilities in supply chains.  \n2. Invest in adaptive infrastructure and technology to mitigate the effects of extreme weather events.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Supply chain\" refers to the network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product.  \n- \"Climate change\" is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place, which can affect various sectors, including manufacturing.",
