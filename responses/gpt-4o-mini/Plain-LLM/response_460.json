  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will changing climate patterns affect the potential for renewable energy generation across the Iberian Peninsula by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nChanging climate patterns are likely to boost solar and wind energy generation but may pose challenges related to water availability for hydroelectric power.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, the Iberian Peninsula is expected to experience increased temperatures and variable precipitation, enhancing solar and wind energy potential due to higher solar irradiance and wind speeds. However, these climate changes may lead to reduced rainfall and water scarcity, negatively impacting hydroelectric generation. Adaptation strategies, such as integrating diverse renewable sources and improving energy storage systems, will be crucial to maximize renewable energy generation while addressing water-related challenges. Overall, the region stands to benefit from expanding its renewable portfolio, yet must mitigate risks associated with climate variability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased temperatures will enhance solar power generation. | The Iberian Peninsula is projected to have higher solar irradiance levels by 2040. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Water scarcity may hinder hydroelectric power generation. | Regional models indicate potential declines in precipitation affecting water resources. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on IPCC climate projections for Europe.  \n- Data limitations: Localized climate models may vary; some sources lack specific regional focus.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in solar and wind potential, lower confidence in hydrological impacts.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind infrastructure to capitalize on projected increases in renewable energy generation.  \n2. Develop integrated water management strategies to support hydroelectric energy amidst changing rainfall patterns.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Solar irradiance refers to the power per unit area received from the sun, critical for solar energy production.  \n- Hydroelectric generation relies on water flow to produce electricity, thus affected by rainfall patterns.",
