  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving climate patterns affect the development of wind and solar power in India over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nEvolving climate patterns may enhance solar energy potential but could challenge wind energy reliability in India.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next 30 years, evolving climate patterns will likely impact India's wind and solar power landscape. Increasing temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns could enhance the efficiency and viability of solar power, given India’s abundant sunlight. However, an expected rise in extreme weather events, especially altered monsoon patterns, may lead to fluctuations in wind energy production. This presents risks such as increased downtime and variability of power generation. Diversifying energy sources and improving energy storage systems will be critical to manage these changes and capitalize on the solar energy potential while mitigating risks to wind power reliability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Solar power is expected to benefit from increased sunlight and better efficiency. | Studies project increased solar irradiance due to climate warming. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Wind energy production may be adversely affected by altered monsoon patterns and extreme weather. | Research indicates climate change may lead to more erratic wind patterns. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Varies based on climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5 models).  \n- Data limitations: Regional data on specific weather patterns and their impacts on energy production may be limited.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in trends due to ongoing climate modeling research.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in research to understand localized climate impacts on solar and wind availability.  \n2. Develop and enhance energy storage technologies to manage variability in wind and solar power generation.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Solar irradiance: The power per unit area received from the sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation.  \n- RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway): A greenhouse gas concentration trajectory used for climate modeling.",
