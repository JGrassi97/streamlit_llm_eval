  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will future climate scenarios influence investment risk in the tourism sector of the Caribbean islands by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFuture climate scenarios will increase investment risks in the Caribbean tourism sector due to heightened natural disasters, rising sea levels, and changing weather patterns.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, investment risks in the Caribbean tourism sector are expected to intensify due to climate change impacts. Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, threaten infrastructure and tourist safety. Rising sea levels can damage coastal areas where resorts are located, leading to property devaluation. Additionally, changing weather patterns may affect tourist seasons and preferences. While these challenges present risks, they also create opportunities for sustainable tourism practices and eco-friendly investments, enabling resilience building within the sector.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased extreme weather events pose risks to infrastructure and tourism safety. | Studies show rising trends in hurricane frequency in the Caribbean. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Rising sea levels threaten coastal tourist resorts. | Projections indicate significant sea-level rise impacting coastal land. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes varying degrees of climate change scenarios leading to more extreme events by 2035.  \n- Data limitations: Specific quantifiable impacts on investment returns and detailed regional analyses are not available.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on available climate trend data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure to mitigate risks from extreme weather and sea-level rise.  \n2. Encourage diversification of tourism offerings, such as eco-tourism, to adapt to changing climate patterns and attract new market segments.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Resilient infrastructure\" refers to buildings and facilities designed to withstand extreme weather conditions.  \n- \"Eco-tourism\" is a sustainable approach to tourism that focuses on conservation and minimizing environmental impact.",
