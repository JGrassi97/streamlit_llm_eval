  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat changes to energy infrastructure will be needed in the Nordic countries to adapt to new climate realities over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nThe Nordic countries will need to enhance renewable energy capacity, upgrade grid infrastructure, and improve energy efficiency to adapt to climate changes.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nTo adapt to new climate realities over the next two decades, Nordic countries must prioritize the expansion of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. Additionally, retrofitting existing grid infrastructure to accommodate decentralized energy production and enhance resilience against extreme weather events will be crucial. Key drivers include increasing energy demand and the need for carbon neutrality goals. Opportunities exist in innovation and investment in smart grid technology, while risks include potential disruptions to energy supply and challenges in regulatory frameworks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Nordic countries aim for carbon neutrality by 2050, necessitating renewable energy expansion. | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| 2 | Climate change is projected to increase energy demand across the region. | IPCC 2021 report | [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/) | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: The analysis is based on projected climate impacts and policy frameworks up to 2050.  \n- Data limitations: Limited data on specific regional impacts of climate change on energy supply and demand.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in the need for renewable expansion; medium confidence in grid infrastructure readiness.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in the development of offshore wind farms and solar energy projects to diversify energy sources.  \n2. Upgrade grid infrastructure to integrate more distributed energy resources and enhance system resiliency.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Renewable energy: Energy sourced from naturally replenishing systems, like wind and solar.  \n- Grid infrastructure: The physical networks for generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity.",
