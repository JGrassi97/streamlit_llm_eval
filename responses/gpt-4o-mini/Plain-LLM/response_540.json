  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the anticipated public health consequences of climate change in the Bay of Bengal region over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change will likely increase the prevalence of waterborne diseases, heat-related illnesses, and respiratory conditions in the Bay of Bengal region.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nThe Bay of Bengal region is expected to face significant public health challenges over the next 30 years due to climate change. Rising temperatures and increased flooding will contribute to a surge in waterborne diseases such as cholera and dysentery. Additionally, heatwaves may lead to higher incidences of heat-related illnesses, particularly among vulnerable populations. Furthermore, changes in weather patterns are predicted to exacerbate respiratory conditions due to stagnant air and increased air pollution. Mitigating these health impacts requires urgent public health strategies focused on disease surveillance, infrastructure improvement, and community engagement.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased temperatures will raise the incidence of heat-related illnesses. | Projected rise in temperatures by 2°C in the region by 2050. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Flooding will heighten the risk of waterborne diseases. | Historical data indicates a 20% increase in cholera during flood events. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future climate modeling shows varying projections, especially considering local socio-economic factors.  \n- Data limitations: Limited access to localized health data and climate modeling specific to the Bay of Bengal.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on existing studies and climate models.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Strengthen water and sanitation infrastructure to mitigate waterborne diseases.  \n2. Implement community health education programs focused on heat management and disease prevention.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Waterborne diseases: Illnesses caused by consuming contaminated water, often leading to gastrointestinal issues.  \n- Heat-related illnesses: Health issues caused by excessive heat exposure, including heat exhaustion and heat stroke.",
