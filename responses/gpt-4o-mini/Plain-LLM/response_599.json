  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the potential financial impact of increased summer temperatures on the operating costs (e.g., cooling) for data centers located near Dublin, Ireland, over the next 20 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased summer temperatures are likely to raise cooling costs for Dublin-based data centers by 10-30%, significantly impacting overall operating expenses.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected increases in summer temperatures around Dublin due to climate change could elevate cooling demands for data centers, resulting in a forecasted rise in energy costs. Cooling systems, which account for a substantial portion of data center operating expenses, may see cost increases of 10-30% over the next two decades. This effect could be exacerbated by the rising costs of electricity and potential regulatory changes favoring sustainable practices. Mitigation strategies such as adopting more efficient cooling technologies could offer some financial relief, yet failing to adapt could significantly affect profitability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased temperatures lead to higher cooling costs. | Cooling costs represent 30-50% of data center operating costs. | N/A | numeric |\n| 2 | Projected temperature rise will strain energy resources. | Average summer temperatures are expected to rise by 1-2°C in the next 20 years. | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes a moderate climate change scenario with a projected 1-2°C increase in summer temperatures over 20 years.  \n- Data limitations: Lack of specific local data on future electricity prices and cooling technology advancements.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on current climate models and historical data on cooling requirements.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in energy-efficient cooling systems to minimize rising costs.  \n2. Implement renewable energy solutions to offset increased energy expenses.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Cooling costs\": Refers to the expenses associated with temperature regulation in data centers, which includes energy consumption for air conditioning systems.  \n- \"Energy-efficient cooling systems\": These systems use less electricity while maintaining optimal operating temperatures.",
