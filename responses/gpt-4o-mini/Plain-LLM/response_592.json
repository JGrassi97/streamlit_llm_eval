  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will an increase in the frequency of intense rainfall events affect flood insurance premiums for residential properties in Houston, Texas, by 2035? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased rainfall intensity is likely to drive up flood insurance premiums for residential properties in Houston by 2035.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nAs climate change leads to more intense rainfall events in Houston, flood risks will rise, prompting insurance providers to adjust premiums accordingly. The frequency and severity of flooding can lead to higher claims costs, resulting in increased insurance rates. Additionally, regulatory changes and reactions from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) could further influence premiums. Homeowners may face significant financial burdens as costs rise, with potential shifts in market dynamics affecting property values and insurability. Risk mitigation strategies will be essential to counterbalance these impacts.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased rainfall will elevate flood risks and premiums. | Climate models project increased rainfall frequency leading to heightened flooding risks. | N/A | N/A |\n| 2 | Flood insurance premiums correlate with risk levels. | Insurers adjust premiums based on historical claims data and risk assessments. | N/A | N/A |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Increased rainfall events predicted under climate change models.  \n- Data limitations: Lack of specific local historical data on insurance premium changes in response to flooding.  \n- Confidence statements: Some uncertainty exists due to changing climate policies and market responses.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Homeowners should assess and improve flood resilience measures in their properties to potentially lower future insurance premiums.  \n2. Engage with local government and community planning to advocate for improved drainage and flood management systems.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Flood insurance premiums\" refer to the costs homeowners must pay to protect against financial loss from flooding.  \n- \"Intense rainfall events\" indicate periods of heavy rainfall that can lead to flooding.",
