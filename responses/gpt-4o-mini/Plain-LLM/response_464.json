  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will future climate conditions impact the mix of renewable energy sources in Germany by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFuture climate conditions are likely to enhance Germany's reliance on wind and solar energy while challenging biomass and hydropower.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, Germany's renewable energy mix will be influenced by changes in climate patterns, notably increased temperatures and altered precipitation. These conditions are anticipated to boost solar and wind energy production due to more frequent sunny and windy days. However, biomass could be impacted by droughts affecting crop yields and water availability may threaten hydropower generation. This shift presents opportunities for technological advancements in solar and wind energy solutions, but also risks as traditional energy sources might face instability in production.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased temperatures are expected to enhance solar efficiency. | \"Higher temperatures can improve the efficiency of solar panels.\" | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Changes in precipitation will impact biomass and hydropower. | \"Drought conditions may disrupt biomass crop yields and affect reservoir levels for hydropower.\" | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future climate models vary in predictions for wind and sun patterns.  \n- Data limitations: Specific regional data on precipitation and temperature changes are limited.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in trends based on current climate models.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in energy-storage technologies to manage the variability of wind and solar energy.  \n2. Develop adaptive management strategies for biomass and hydropower systems in response to climate variability.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Renewable energy: Energy from sources that are naturally replenished, such as solar and wind.  \n- Biomass: Organic materials used for fuel, such as plant materials and animal waste.  \n- Hydropower: Energy generated from the movement of water.
