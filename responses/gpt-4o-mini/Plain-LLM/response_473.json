  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected change in solar panel energy output during summer months in Seville, Spain, due to higher average temperatures between 2030 and 2040? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected energy output of solar panels in Seville may decrease due to higher temperatures, affecting efficiency.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nAs temperatures rise in Seville between 2030 and 2040, solar panel efficiency is likely to decline. Higher temperatures can reduce energy output due to increased resistance in photovoltaic cells. This phenomenon can lead to a reduction in overall energy yield during the summer months when energy demand is typically highest. However, advancements in solar technology and improved cooling methods may mitigate some of the negative impacts. Monitoring temperature and solar radiation patterns will be essential to adapt strategies for optimal energy production during this period.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Higher temperatures can reduce solar panel efficiency. | Observational data suggests a decrease in efficiency at elevated temperatures. | N/A | citation | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Temperature increase predictions are based on general climate models for Southern Europe.  \n- Data limitations: Long-term local weather data may vary; variability in solar technology responses to temperature changes is not fully captured.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on historical performance of solar panels with temperature variations.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in research on advanced solar technologies that maintain efficiency at higher temperatures.  \n2. Explore installation of cooling system solutions for solar panels to mitigate heat impact on performance.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Photovoltaic cells are the components in solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity. Higher temperatures can lead to inefficiencies in these cells, reducing overall energy output.  \n- N/A",
