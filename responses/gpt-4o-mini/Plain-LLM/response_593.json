  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of rising temperatures on the financial viability of cattle farming operations in Queensland, Australia, due to increased costs for water and feed by 2040? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures by 2040 are likely to significantly increase water and feed costs, jeopardizing the financial viability of cattle farming in Queensland.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, rising temperatures in Queensland are projected to escalate costs for water and feed, critical inputs for cattle farming. Increased heat can lead to water scarcity, raising irrigation and stock water expenses, while higher temperatures may reduce pasture quality and availability, necessitating more expensive supplementary feed. The compounded effect could threaten profit margins and financial stability for cattle operations. Opportunities may exist in adopting climate-resilient practices, but the immediate risks to viability due to operational cost increases are significant.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures will increase water costs and reduce pasture availability. | Increased temperatures are associated with higher evaporation and reduced water supply; additionally, hotter periods decrease pasture growth. | N/A | N/A |\n| 2 | Supplementary feed costs are expected to rise due to lower pasture quality. | Diminished pasture growth leads to higher dependence on feed, which is subject to market fluctuations. | N/A | N/A |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Various climate models project differing temperature increases; \"N/A\"  \n- Data limitations: Specific local economic impact data and agricultural responses are limited; \"N/A\"  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on general climate impact assumptions; \"N/A\"\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement water conservation and management strategies to mitigate rising water costs.  \n2. Invest in climate-resilient feed alternatives to ensure stable feeding costs as pastures decline.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Pasture: Grassland where cattle graze; its health is crucial for cattle farming viability.  \n- Supplementary feed: Additional feed provided to livestock to offset lower pasture availability.",
