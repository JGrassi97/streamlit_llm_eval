  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving wind patterns affect financial risk planning in Oujda, Morocco during 2020-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nEvolving wind patterns could increase the frequency of extreme weather events, affecting agriculture, energy production, and infrastructure investments in Oujda.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nChanges in wind patterns due to climate change could lead to increased frequency and intensity of storms and droughts in Oujda, Morocco, with significant implications for financial risk planning. The agricultural sector may face yield variability, impacting food security and local economies. Additionally, energy infrastructure, particularly wind and solar farms, could see shifts in productivity and financial returns. Understanding these dynamics is essential for establishing insurance models and investment strategies that mitigate financial exposure to climate-related risks. Opportunities for investment in resilient infrastructure and sustainable agriculture practices could arise if adequately planned for.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Changing wind patterns can lead to increased extreme weather events. | Studies indicate wind patterns are becoming more erratic due to climate change, potentially causing more storms and droughts. | IPCC Report 2021 | citation |\n| 2 | Agriculture in Oujda may experience yield variability due to wind and climate changes. | Research shows that climate variability can impact agricultural productivity significantly in Mediterranean regions. | FAO 2022 | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projected climate models indicate various potential increases in wind speeds and storm frequency.  \n- Data limitations: Long-term localized climate data specific to Oujda is limited due to historical observation gaps.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence (approximately 70%) based on current climate models and observed trends.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop adaptive agricultural frameworks to enhance crop resilience against climate-induced wind and weather variations.  \n2. Invest in infrastructure upgrades for energy systems to accommodate potential changes in wind energy outputs.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Extreme weather events” refers to phenomena like storms, flooding, and droughts that occur with increased intensity due to climate change.  \n- “Resilient infrastructure” means buildings and systems designed to withstand climate challenges and minimize financial losses.",
