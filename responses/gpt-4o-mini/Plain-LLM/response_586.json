  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the systemic financial risks that climate change poses to the agricultural lending portfolios of banks in the US Midwest? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change introduces significant systemic financial risks to agricultural lending portfolios through increased volatility in crop yields, heightened insurance claims, and deteriorating asset values.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nClimate change threatens the agricultural lending portfolios of banks in the US Midwest by exacerbating risks such as extreme weather events, shifting growing seasons, and soil degradation. Increased volatility in crop yields can lead to higher default rates among farmers, while rising insurance costs may further strain financial resources. Additionally, the long-term impacts on land productivity could lead to decreased asset values, undermining collateral for loans. Conversely, banks may find opportunities in financing sustainable agricultural practices, promoting resilience against climate impacts, and diversifying risk through green financial products.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Climate change increases crop yield volatility in the Midwest. | Historical yield data show fluctuations tied to weather extremes. | N/A | N/A | \n| 2 | Rising insurance costs are linked to increased natural disasters. | Historical data highlight a trend in rising crop insurance premiums. | N/A | N/A | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: Limited access to specific datasets relating to every individual state or crop type in the Midwest.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence level based on general climate trends and agriculture risk assessments.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Assess and adjust lending criteria to factor in climate risks and volatility in agriculture, incorporating dynamic risk models.\n2. Develop financing products that encourage climate resilience practices among farmers, such as sustainable farming techniques and conservation efforts.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Crop yield volatility refers to the variations in agricultural output due to external factors, including climate conditions.  \n- Asset values may refer to the worth of land and properties used as collateral for agricultural loans, which may decline due to poor environmental conditions.",
