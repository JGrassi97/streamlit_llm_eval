  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might future temperature conditions influence the stability of financial markets in Nouakchott, Mauritania over the coming decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures could increase economic instability in Nouakchott through agricultural shocks, reduced productivity, and heightened risks from climate-related events.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nFuture temperature conditions in Nouakchott are likely to impact financial markets significantly due to their strong reliance on agriculture and natural resources. Increased temperatures can lead to droughts, affecting crop yields and food security, which in turn could destabilize local economies. The informal economy, which is substantial in Mauritania, may also face heightened volatility as rural families dependent on agriculture confront unpredictable climatic conditions. However, opportunities for innovation in climate adaptation and sustainable investment could arise if financial markets effectively respond to these challenges.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures negatively affect agricultural productivity. | Studies indicate that each degree Celsius increase in temperature can reduce agricultural yields by 10-25%. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Informal economies are more vulnerable to climate-induced shocks. | Research shows informal sectors often lack the resilience mechanisms of formal economies, increasing risks in adverse conditions. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Impact assessments depend on various climate models projecting temperature increases.  \n- Data limitations: Limited empirical data specific to Nouakchott's economic vulnerability to temperature increases.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on global climate trends and agricultural data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Promote investment in climate-resilient agricultural practices to stabilize income for farmers.  \n2. Develop financial products tailored to mitigate risks for informal sector workers affected by climate variability.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Climate resilience\" refers to the ability to adapt to changing climate conditions while maintaining functionality and recovering from adverse impacts.  \n- \"Informal economy\" includes economic activities that are not regulated by the government, often leading to instability and vulnerability.",
