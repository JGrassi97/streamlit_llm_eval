  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected effect of climate change on the reliability of the electrical grid in the Southwestern United States during summer months up to 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is expected to significantly reduce the reliability of the electrical grid in the Southwestern United States due to increased temperatures and prolonged droughts.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, climate change will likely exacerbate summer heatwaves and droughts in the Southwestern United States, leading to increased demand for electricity for cooling and decreased water availability for hydropower generation and thermoelectric cooling. These factors combined may cause power outages and strain the electrical grid. Key risks include infrastructure not being resilient enough to handle higher temperatures and prolonged dry periods, while opportunities may exist in enhancing grid reliability through renewable energy investments and energy efficiency measures.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased temperatures may lead to higher electricity demand. | Projections indicate temperatures can rise by up to 4°F, increasing cooling demand. | \"N/A\" | citation | \n| 2 | Droughts can decrease water availability for power generation. | Over 60% of power in the region can be affected by drought conditions. | \"N/A\" | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on varying climate models, assuming continued emissions trends.  \n- Data limitations: Limited regional studies specific to grid reliability under climate stress.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence due to variability in climate scenarios.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in renewable energy sources like solar and wind to diversify the energy supply.  \n2. Enhance grid infrastructure to withstand higher temperatures and implement energy efficiency programs.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Electrical grid: A system that delivers electricity from producers to consumers.  \n- Hydropower: Electricity generated from the energy of moving water.  \n\n*If no technical terms used, write \"N/A\"*",
