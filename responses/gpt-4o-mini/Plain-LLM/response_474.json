  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might an increase in calm, low-wind days affect the reliability of wind power generation in the state of Iowa, USA, over the next decade?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nAn increase in calm, low-wind days is likely to decrease the reliability of wind power generation in Iowa.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nAn increase in calm, low-wind days will negatively impact wind power reliability in Iowa by reducing the average energy output from wind turbines, essential for meeting electricity demands. Key drivers include heightened demand for consistent energy amidst cleaner energy transitions and fluctuations in weather patterns. While diversification of energy sources may mitigate some risks, the dependency on wind energy for a significant portion of Iowa's electricity can exacerbate supply consistency issues if low-wind phenomena increase. Emphasizing energy storage solutions and integrating various energy sources will be crucial to managing this challenge over the next decade.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | An increase in low-wind days reduces energy production from wind turbines. | Wind power generation decreases significantly during respective calm periods. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Iowa relies heavily on wind power for electricity. | Approximately 40% of Iowa's electricity is generated from wind. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future climate models vary; specific projections for wind speed trends in Iowa's climate are uncertain.  \n- Data limitations: Limited historic data on long-term calm day frequency adds uncertainty to predictions.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on observed trends but uncertainty around future climate impacts.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in energy storage solutions to buffer against low-wind production periods.  \n2. Diversify energy sources to include more reliable alternatives and enhance grid resilience.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Wind power relies on turbine operation; low-wind days mean less or no electricity is generated from these sources.  \n- Energy storage refers to technologies that save electricity for use when demand is higher or wind is lower.",
