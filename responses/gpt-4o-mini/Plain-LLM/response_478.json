  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could changes in average winter temperatures affect the demand on the power grid for heating in Moscow, Russia, during the 2040-2050 period?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising average winter temperatures are likely to reduce heating demand on Moscow's power grid during the 2040-2050 period.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAs average winter temperatures in Moscow rise, the demand for heating is expected to decrease. Warmer winters will likely lead to reduced energy consumption for heating purposes, which could ease stress on the power grid. However, this change may also introduce challenges such as increased demand for cooling in the summer months and impacts on energy pricing. Effectively managing this transition will be crucial to ensure a stable energy supply and infrastructure investment, while also considering potential shifts in consumer behavior and energy policy implications.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type |  \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|  \n| 1 | Average winter temperatures in Moscow are projected to rise by 2-4°C by 2050. | \"Global Warming of 1.5 °C,\" IPCC Special Report, 2018 | N/A | citation |  \n| 2 | Reduced heating demand could lower energy consumption by up to 15% during milder winters. | \"Energy Consumption Trends,\" International Energy Agency, 2020 | N/A | citation |  \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Changes may vary based on global climate policies and local adaptations.  \n- Data limitations: Projections are based on climate models that include uncertainties.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderately confident based on current trends and historical data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in flexible energy systems that can adapt to shifts in heating and cooling demands.  \n2. Promote energy efficiency measures in buildings to optimize consumption patterns.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Heating demand refers to the energy required to keep indoor environments warm during cold weather.  \n- Energy efficiency measures are strategies to reduce energy use while maintaining the same level of comfort or service.",
