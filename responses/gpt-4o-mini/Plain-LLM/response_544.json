  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat public health challenges will arise from climate change in the densely populated river deltas of Southeast Asia over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreasing flooding, heatwaves, and vector-borne diseases will exacerbate public health challenges in Southeast Asia's river deltas.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nClimate change poses critical public health risks in the densely populated river deltas of Southeast Asia, primarily through rising sea levels, increased flooding, and higher temperatures. These factors contribute to the heightened incidence of waterborne diseases, such as cholera, and vector-borne illnesses like dengue fever and malaria. Vulnerable populations face food security threats from reduced agricultural productivity. Additionally, urbanization in these delta regions may lead to insufficient infrastructure to manage health crises. Addressing these challenges requires timely interventions and adaptations in healthcare delivery, sanitation, and public awareness campaigns.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising sea levels will increase flooding risks. | Global sea levels are expected to rise by 0.5 to 1 meter by 2100. | IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere | citation |\n| 2 | Increased heat will amplify vector-borne diseases. | Heatwaves are projected to become more frequent, with a 2-3 degree Celsius rise in temperatures. | WHO Climate Change and Health report | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Climate models estimate a range of sea level scenarios based on global emissions pathways.  \n- Data limitations: Localized health data may not be fully representative or current.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in the association between climate change and health impacts, but variability exists based on specific regional factors.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop integrated surveillance systems for monitoring vector-borne and waterborne diseases in delta regions.  \n2. Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, including improved drainage systems and sanitation facilities, to mitigate flooding impacts.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Vector-borne diseases: Illnesses transmitted through insects, such as mosquitoes, that thrive in warmer conditions.\n- Waterborne diseases: Illnesses caused by pathogens in contaminated water, such as cholera.",
