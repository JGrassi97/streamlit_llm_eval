  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the broad financial risks posed by climate change to the real estate market in South Florida, USA, over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change poses significant financial risks to South Florida's real estate market through increased flooding, hurricanes, and decreasing property values.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nOver the next 30 years, South Florida's real estate market faces substantial financial risks due to climate change, primarily from rising sea levels, intensified storms, and flooding. These environmental factors can lead to property damage, increased insurance costs, and reduced market demand, thereby depressing property values. Vulnerable coastal areas may become less desirable for buyers and investors, potentially resulting in significant financial losses. However, there are opportunities for innovation in resilient infrastructure and sustainable developments, which may mitigate some risks and attract investment.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Sea levels in South Florida are projected to rise significantly, increasing flood risks. | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| 2 | Increased frequency of hurricanes can lead to higher property damage and insurance costs. | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: N/A  \n- Confidence statements: N/A\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement stricter building codes and requirements for flood-resistant construction in vulnerable areas.  \n2. Encourage investment in green infrastructure and climate-resilient development projects.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Flooding: The overflow of water onto normally dry land, often due to heavy rainfall or sea level rise.  \n- Infrastructure: The physical systems and structures that support a community, including roads, bridges, and buildings.",
