  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of rising average temperatures and subsequent increased air conditioning load on the efficiency of solar farms in the Atacama Desert, Chile, by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased temperatures could enhance solar farm output, but higher air conditioning loads may strain local energy resources.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, rising temperatures in the Atacama Desert are likely to increase the output of solar farms due to enhanced solar irradiance. However, the concurrent rise in air conditioning demand could lead to increased energy consumption, impacting the overall system efficiency. The high solar capacity factor in the region presents an opportunity for optimizing energy production, while the need for additional cooling systems could create risks of overloading local infrastructure. This scenario stresses the importance of integrating energy storage solutions to manage fluctuations in demand and supply effectively.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Higher temperatures generally boost solar panel efficiency up to an optimal range. | Studies indicate solar panels perform better at higher irradiance levels even with increased temperatures. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Increased air conditioning demand could double energy consumption during peak heat. | Projections suggest a significant rise in cooling needs as temperatures rise. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes a moderate rise in temperature and incremental increases in air conditioning load.  \n- Data limitations: General trends in temperature and energy demand are well-documented, but specific projections may vary.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium confidence based on existing trends in solar performance and energy demand.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in energy storage systems to balance supply and demand, especially during peak AC load periods.  \n2. Explore innovative cooling solutions for solar panels to maintain efficiency despite rising temperatures.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Solar irradiance: The power per unit area received from the sun, which affects solar panel performance.  \n- Capacity factor: The ratio of actual output over a period to the potential output if the maximum capacity was used continuously.",
