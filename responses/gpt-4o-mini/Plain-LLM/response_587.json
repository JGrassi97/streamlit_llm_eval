  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will climate risk be integrated into property insurance pricing in wildfire-prone areas of California over the next decade?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate risk will increasingly influence insurance pricing through sophisticated risk modeling, regulatory changes, and market demand for sustainable practices.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nOver the next decade, property insurance pricing in California's wildfire-prone areas will incorporate climate risk through enhanced data analytics and risk assessment models. Insurers will utilize historical wildfire data, climate forecasts, and geographical mapping to evaluate risks more accurately. Regulatory changes may also mandate transparency and responsibility in pricing, while consumer demand for sustainable practices pushes insurers to adopt climate-resilient models. However, risks include potential market instability if insurance becomes unaffordable for high-risk properties, leading to a broader conversation about risk-sharing and community resilience.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Insurers are adopting data analytics for pricing in wildfire zones. | Historical data and predictive algorithms are increasingly used for risk assessment. | N/A | text |  \n| 2 | Regulatory changes may affect insurance practices in California. | California government initiatives focus on climate risk disclosure. | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: Specific forecasting data and insurer responses vary and may not be uniformly available.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence due to changing regulatory landscapes and insurer practices.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Insurers should invest in advanced data analytics to better assess climate risks related to wildfires.  \n2. Industry stakeholders should advocate for clear regulatory frameworks that support sustainable insurance practices.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Climate risk refers to the potential negative impacts on properties and investments due to climate change, which in this context relates specifically to increased frequency and severity of wildfires.  \n- Regulatory changes refer to new laws or guidelines that affect how insurers assess and disclose risks related to climate change.",
