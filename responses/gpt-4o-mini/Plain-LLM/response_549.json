  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will the health impacts of climate change differ between urban and rural populations in India by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nUrban populations will face higher heat-related illnesses and pollution exposure, while rural areas will struggle more with water scarcity and vector-borne diseases.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, climate change will lead to distinct health impacts in urban and rural populations in India. Urban residents are likely to experience increased heat-related illnesses due to rising temperatures and poor air quality from pollution, exacerbated by urbanization. In contrast, rural populations may face greater challenges from water scarcity, impacting food security and nutrition, along with a rise in vector-borne diseases linked to changing climate patterns. Effective healthcare systems and adaptation strategies will be crucial in mitigating these impacts for both demographics.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Urban areas will see higher temperature-related health issues. | Heatwave events have increased, with urban heat islands affecting populations. | National Disaster Management Authority Report | citation |\n| 2 | Rural populations will be more susceptible to waterborne diseases. | Projected water shortages and floods will increase vector-borne diseases risk. | WHO Climate Change and Health Report | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections based on current climate models for India.  \n- Data limitations: Regional variability not fully captured in available reports.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on existing projections and studies.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement urban heat resilience strategies, including green roofs and increased green spaces.  \n2. Strengthen water management and sanitation infrastructure in rural areas to mitigate disease spread.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Urban heat island: This refers to urban areas being significantly warmer than their rural surroundings due to human activities.  \n- Vector-borne diseases: Illnesses transmitted by vectors like mosquitoes and ticks, which can proliferate due to warmer temperatures.",
