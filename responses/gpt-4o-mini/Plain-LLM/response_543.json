  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow is climate change expected to impact the overall health and well-being of communities in the European Mediterranean by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is projected to exacerbate health risks, increase heat-related illnesses, and challenge water and food security in the European Mediterranean by 2035.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, climate change is expected to significantly affect health and well-being in the European Mediterranean due to rising temperatures, increased frequency of heatwaves, and changes in precipitation patterns. These factors are likely to result in heightened risks of heat stress, respiratory diseases, and vector-borne illnesses. Vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and lower-income groups, may face greater challenges with access to clean water and food security. Moreover, air quality deterioration may aggravate existing health conditions. Opportunities to mitigate these risks exist through enhanced public health strategies, sustainable water management, and increased resilience in health systems.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased heat-related illnesses are anticipated due to rising temperatures. | Projections indicate a 1.5–2°C rise in average temperatures leading to more frequent heatwaves. | N/A | citation |\n| 2 | Vulnerability of lower-income groups to food insecurity will increase. | Studies show that 70% of lower-income communities rely on climate-sensitive resources that are projected to be affected. | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections based on climate models that predict a range of temperature increases from 1.5°C to 2°C.  \n- Data limitations: Data on local adaptation strategies and socioeconomic responses may vary significantly across regions.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in projections, as future trends could be influenced by unforeseen technological, political, or environmental changes.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement community-focused health initiatives aimed at educating residents about heat risk management and personal health during extreme weather events.  \n2. Develop local agricultural programs that promote climate-resilient crops and sustainable irrigation techniques to enhance food security.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Heat stress\" refers to health complications caused by excessive heat exposure, affecting normal body functions.  \n- \"Vector-borne illnesses\" are diseases transmitted by vectors such as mosquitoes, which thrive in warmer climates.",
