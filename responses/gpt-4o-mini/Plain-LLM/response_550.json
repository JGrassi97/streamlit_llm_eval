  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow is the geographic range for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector for dengue fever, expected to change in southern Europe due to rising average winter temperatures by 2035, for example near Rome, Italy?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nThe range of Aedes aegypti is projected to expand into southern Europe, including areas near Rome, due to warmer winter temperatures.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nRising average winter temperatures in southern Europe by 2035 are expected to create favorable conditions for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, facilitating its expansion into areas like Rome, Italy. Warmer winters lower mosquito mortality and extend their breeding season, increasing the likelihood of dengue fever outbreaks. However, the actual impact will depend on other environmental factors and public health responses. The risk of increased vector-borne diseases poses a significant challenge to health systems, but it also presents opportunities for improved surveillance and control strategies across vulnerable regions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Aedes aegypti range is expanding into Europe. | Climate models predict range shifts due to temperature increases. | European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) | Citation |\n| 2 | Warmer winters correlate with longer mosquito breeding seasons. | Research indicates warmer temperatures reduce mortality rates of Aedes mosquitoes. | Journal of Medical Entomology | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Future climate projections based on current trends.  \n- Data limitations: Variability in local climatic conditions and vector control measures.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on current climate modeling.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Enhance mosquito surveillance programs in southern Europe to monitor Aedes aegypti populations effectively.  \n2. Develop public health campaigns to educate communities about dengue fever and prevention measures.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Aedes aegypti: A type of mosquito that can transmit diseases like dengue fever.  \n- Vector-borne diseases: Diseases transmitted by vectors, such as mosquitoes, that can significantly impact public health.",
