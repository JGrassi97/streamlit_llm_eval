  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow is the geographic range for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector for dengue fever, expected to change in southern Europe due to rising average winter temperatures by 2035, for example near Rome, Italy?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2035, rising winter temperatures near Rome will nearly meet the thermal threshold for Aedes aegypti’s year-round survival, supporting northward expansion and increasing establishment risk; full persistence is expected in the following decade.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nRising winter temperatures in Rome (monthly means: December 7.9°C, January 7.6°C, February 11.9°C projected for 2030–2039) are approaching the critical >10°C threshold for year-round Aedes aegypti survival. By 2035, the mosquito's overwintering barrier is much reduced—especially as freeze-thaw days drop to ~4/year—permitting northward range expansion across southern Europe’s coasts. While not all winter months in Rome exceed the 10°C mean by 2035, February already does, enabling seasonal population persistence; permanent establishment is likely in subsequent decades. This shift raises the risk of dengue and other vector-borne diseases, necessitating early surveillance and public health adaptation.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rome’s winter temperatures will approach Aedes aegypti’s >10°C mean threshold by 2035 | Projected monthly means: Dec 7.9°C, Jan 7.6°C, Feb 11.9°C (2030-2039) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble | numeric |\n| 2 | Freeze-thaw (cold-stress) days will drop to ~4/year by 2035–2040 | Freeze-thaw days annual mean: 4.3/year (2021–2035), 3.9/year (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP analysis | numeric |\n| 3 | Range expansion and establishment risk increase as winter warming eliminates cold barriers | Northward movement of overwintering isotherm by ~100–300 km; urban heat islands enhance risk | XCLIM analysis, expert consensus | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis uses CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 “high emissions” scenario, multi-model ensemble mean.  \n- Data limitations: Local microclimate and extreme cold event variability are not captured at fine scale; urban heat island effects may locally accelerate overwintering thresholds.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in overall warming trend and declining cold events; moderate on precise year of full establishment threshold crossing.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Initiate targeted vector surveillance and environmental monitoring in Rome and similar southern European cities, focusing on winter/spring.  \n2. Prepare public health, vector control, and urban water management programs for heightened Aedes aegypti presence, especially after extremely warm winters.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Freeze-thaw days” refers to days when the temperature moves above and below freezing, which can kill mosquito larvae.  \n- “Overwintering threshold” is the minimum winter average temperature mosquitoes need to survive until spring.
