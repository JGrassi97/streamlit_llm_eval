  "QuestionText": "How is the geographic range for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector for dengue fever, expected to change in southern Europe due to rising average winter temperatures by 2035, for example near Rome, Italy?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2035, the geographic range for the Aedes aegypti mosquito near Rome, Italy, is projected to expand and become more stable due to warmer average winter temperatures. Model projections indicate Rome will maintain mean winter temperatures between approximately 7.5°C and 13°C, with a significant reduction in the number of days experiencing freezing conditions. These milder winters remove one of the main climatic barriers that historically restricted Aedes aegypti survival and overwintering, suggesting the species’ local persistence and extension further into southern Europe is highly likely.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Warmer winters and fewer freeze events will allow Aedes aegypti to survive and reproduce throughout the year, increasing the risk of dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases in Rome and similar southern European cities.\n- This change has direct implications for public health, urban planning, and vector management strategies, necessitating proactive adaptation measures as the vector expands its range.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Projected winter mean temperatures (Dec–Feb) for Rome in 2035 will typically be 7.5–13°C, above the critical threshold for Aedes aegypti survival. | Model dataset for 2030–2039, showing Jan: 7.9°C, Feb: 7.6°C, Dec: 11.9°C | nextGEMS climate model |\n| 2 | Number of winter freeze days (T<0°C) in Rome will decline, rarely forming sustained barriers to mosquito survival. | CMIP6 ensemble projections and climate indices; historical average ~14 days/year, decreasing to ~7 by mid-century | XCLIM_AI tech analysis |\n| 3 | Aedes aegypti successfully persists in regions where mean winter temperatures exceed 7–10°C and winter freezes are infrequent. | Wikipedia scientific summary and cited literature | Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_aegypti |\n| 4 | Ongoing poleward (northward) spread of Aedes aegypti is facilitated by global climate warming. | Peer-reviewed research and IPCC summaries | IPCC; Wikipedia |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Data and claims are supported by cutting-edge climate models (CMIP6, nextGEMS), technical analyses, and scientific consensus found in peer-reviewed literature and large-scale assessments. These sources provide a high degree of reliability for the stated conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile the climate models demonstrate clear warming and a reduction in cold extremes, some year-to-year variability in minimum winter temperatures will persist. Occasional short cold spells may still occur, but the projected averages strongly favor Aedes aegypti survival. There remains some uncertainty regarding microclimatic urban effects, the adaptability of the mosquitoes, and localized breeding site availability, which could modulate risk at a finer scale. Nonetheless, the removal of frequent and sustained freezing temperatures is a fundamental and robust predictor of mosquito population persistence.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Increase investment in local mosquito surveillance and control initiatives. Authorities in Rome and surrounding regions should expand monitoring for Aedes aegypti presence and respond quickly to early detections to slow or prevent establishment.\n2. Launch targeted public health campaigns to educate citizens about removing stagnant water—from containers, vases, and artificial reservoirs—to reduce available breeding sites and lower the risk of dengue and other mosquito-borne disease outbreaks.\n\n---",
