  "QuestionText": "What are the broad financial risks posed by climate change to the real estate market in South Florida, USA, over the next 30 years?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n What are the broad financial risks posed by climate change to the real estate market in South Florida, USA, over the next 30 years? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nThe South Florida real estate market faces mounting financial risk from chronic extreme heat, insurance volatility, asset value instability, and increasing exposure to hurricane, flood, and sea level rise over the next 30 years.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nWithin 30 years, South Florida’s real estate will be increasingly exposed to sustained extreme heat (annual heatwave days rising from 272 to 303), placing persistent stress on infrastructure, habitability, and property values. Acute risks from hurricanes, flooding, and sea level rise will result in insurance cost escalation, possible loss of insurability for some properties, and structural asset devaluation. Miami’s status among the world’s most flood-vulnerable major cities, together with elevated hurricane and storm surge risk, will likely further pressure market liquidity and pricing, potentially leaving some assets “stranded.” New development and lending will face greater scrutiny, and resilience investment will be essential to preserve asset value.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Chronic extreme heat will dominate the region’s climate | Annual mean heatwave days: 271.8 (1981–2020), 288.1 (2021–2035), 302.6 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble, XCLIM_AI output | Numeric |\n| 2 | Insurance and property market volatility will rise | Hot spell frequency ~10/year and multiple days above 30°C per event, with compounded hurricane/flood/sea level rise risks | CMIP6 models, Wikipedia analysis | Mixed |\n| 3 | $10.5 trillion of coastal U.S. homes at hurricane-force wind risk (incl. South FL) | 33 million homes, 6.5 million at increased flood risk on Atlantic/Gulf coasts | Wikipedia (citing industry/state reports) | Citation |\n| 4 | Miami is a top-10 global city for flood vulnerability | Ranked by OECD among world’s most at-risk | Wikipedia | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections use high-end modeling (SSP5-8.5), representing “worst-case” climate impact.  \n- Data limitations: Precipitation and hurricane/flood event projections derived from global/regional modeling, which involves uncertainty.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence for chronic heat and insurance risk trends; moderate for compounding wind/flood impacts.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in resilience: Retrofit or elevate existing properties and infrastructure to withstand heat, wind, and flood; enforce updated building codes.\n2. Mandate and utilize climate risk disclosures for real estate transactions, mortgages, and insurance pricing to avoid underestimating exposure.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Heatwave index” = days/year with at least 5 consecutive days above 25°C; “hot spell” = at least 3 consecutive days above 30°C.\n- “Ensemble mean” is the average of many climate models to smooth out anomalies and give a robust regional trend.\n\n",
