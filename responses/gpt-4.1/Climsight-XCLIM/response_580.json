  "QuestionText": "What are the broad financial risks posed by climate change to the real estate market in South Florida, USA, over the next 30 years?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nOver the next 30 years, climate change is projected to significantly increase the financial risks faced by the real estate market in South Florida—specifically in areas like Miami-Dade County. Key risk drivers include more frequent and severe heat waves, consistent threats from hurricanes and flooding due to low elevation (8 meters above sea level at this location), and increasing insurance instability as premiums rise or coverage is reduced in high-risk zones. These factors are expected to drive shifts in property values, with highly exposed assets likely to depreciate or face \"stranded asset\" risk, and will prompt tighter lending requirements and higher costs for development and property maintenance. The cumulative result is a future of heightened financial losses for property owners, reduced market liquidity, and an urgent need for robust adaptation and resilience strategies in the face of compounding weather extremes.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- This analysis is built specifically on climate and geographic data relevant to Miami-Dade County, isolating the unique confluence of risks in South Florida: extreme heat projections, coastal vulnerability, and insurance market stress.\n- Understanding these risks is crucial for investors, homeowners, insurance providers, lenders, and regulators who must make long-term decisions as climate trends reshape the economic, regulatory, and physical landscape of real estate markets in the region.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Heat waves in Miami-Dade will exceed 9 per year by 2050, with 4–5 days per year above 35°C. | CMIP6 HighResMIP climate projections, urban climate record analyses | XCLIM_AI, Wikipedia |\n| 2 | Persistent risk from hurricanes, extreme winds, and flooding due to low elevation (8m above sea level at this location). | FEMA flood maps, peer-reviewed syntheses; local elevation data | Wikipedia, get_data_components, RAG_search |\n| 3 | Rising insurance premiums and policy withdrawals in high-risk ZIP codes are already evident and expected to grow. | Insurance industry data, academic and government studies | Wikipedia, RAG_search |\n| 4 | Constructing/resilient retrofitting to newer building codes raises costs by as much as 45% in some parts of Florida. | Peer-reviewed economic studies, Land Economics 2018 | Wikipedia |\n| 5 | 18 million properties nationally are now estimated at high flood risk, up from 8 million per FEMA’s older maps, with over 77,000 at-risk in high-value coastal ZIP codes in Florida. | Peer-reviewed research, risk modeling, FEMA | Wikipedia, RAG_search |\n| 6 | Despite flood risk, South Florida continues rapid coastal development, expanding overall market exposure. | US Census data; real estate market analysis | Wikipedia |\n| 7 | Precipitation and wind-speed averages change only modestly on average, but risk is dominated by extremes and compounding hazards. | Downscaled model data, climate reanalysis | get_data_components |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Evidence relies on peer-reviewed scientific models (CMIP6, HighResMIP), FEMA and insurance industry data, peer-reviewed economics and risk journals, and reputable encyclopedic summaries (Wikipedia consolidating government and peer-reviewed publications).\n- Quantitative statements are founded on robust, multi-model climate ensembles; financial and insurance trends are drawn from authoritative sector and regulatory analyses.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile warming temperatures and the frequency of extreme heat days are well established through ensemble climate projections, significant uncertainties remain regarding the future frequency and intensity of hurricanes, potential for tipping points such as rapid sea level rise, and the details of local flood risk (especially as new development may outpace risk map updates). Regulatory changes, new resilience measures, technological advances, or shifts in public policy could also substantially affect both insurance coverage and real estate values. Likewise, migration patterns and infrastructure investments in Miami-Dade could exacerbate or alleviate pressures on the housing market and financial sector—for better or worse—over the coming decades.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Property owners and developers should invest proactively in resilience: elevate structures, upgrade to hurricane/storm-resistant designs, and employ cooling/flood-proofing measures to preserve asset value and insure-ability.\n2. Regularly monitor insurance requirements and FEMA/bank guidance, adjusting investment and risk management plans as risk maps and lending/insurance rules evolve.\n\n---",
