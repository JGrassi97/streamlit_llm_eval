  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might future temperature conditions influence the stability of financial markets in Nouakchott, Mauritania over the coming decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures and more frequent extreme heat will heighten economic risks and volatility in Nouakchott, threatening financial market stability if adaptation measures are not prioritized.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the coming decades, Nouakchott is projected to experience significant temperature increases, with summer highs exceeding 35 °C and annual mean temperatures rising by more than 1.5 °C by the 2040s. These changes are expected to depress labor productivity, increase health and insurance claims, degrade infrastructure, and challenge agriculture, collectively intensifying volatility in sectors crucial to the region’s financial markets. Even modest temperature increases have been linked to sharply reduced GDP and investment. While targeted adaptation—in infrastructure, finance, and urban planning—could blunt impacts, the absence of proactive responses may prompt asset devaluations, higher risk premiums, and reduced capital flows, undermining market confidence and stability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Summer monthly mean temperatures projected to rise to 36–39°C by 2040s, over 1 °C above 2020s | 2040–2049 simulation: July mean temp 39.11°C; Δ from 2020–2029 is +1.69°C | nextGEMS atmospheric model simulations | numeric |\n| 2 | Even 1 °C global warming reduces global GDP by 12%; 3 °C can halve capital — indicating high economic risk | “A study found that 1 °C warming reduces global GDP by 12%... 3 °C by 2100 could reduce capital by 50%.” | Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change | citation |\n| 3 | Labor productivity in tropical cities drops as extreme heat increases, impacting finance and market sectors | \"Higher temperatures will increasingly prevent outdoor labor in tropical latitudes due to heat stress.\" | Wikipedia; climate-economy literature | text |\n| 4 | Increased volatility and insurance/premium costs expected due to infrastructure, health, and migration impacts | See Wikipedia summary — temperature rise compounds risk across sectors and for vulnerable populations | Wikipedia; IPCC 2023 synth. (as summarized) | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis is based on high-end scenarios/ensembles similar to SSP5-8.5; mitigation or accelerated adaptation may alter outcomes.\n- Data limitations: Localized economic and financial data for Nouakchott are limited, with market-specific risk propagation complex to quantify.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature rise; medium-high confidence in economic and market risks through labor, health, and infrastructure links.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Integrate climate projections into market and insurance risk models; price emerging temperature-linked risks proactively in finance and investment.\n2. Invest in heat-resilient infrastructure, public health systems, and urban adaptation to reduce systemic vulnerability and market exposure.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Δ” means “change in” (e.g., a difference in temperature between decades).\n- “SSP5-8.5” is a high greenhouse gas scenario used to represent “no mitigation” policies in climate modeling.  \n- “nextGEMS” and “CMIP6” refer to advanced global climate models that project future temperature and weather.",
