  "QuestionText": "How will an increase in the number of days with average temperatures exceeding 40°C affect the energy costs for cooling high-tech greenhouses growing cucumbers in the United Arab Emirates by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2035, Dubai will experience an increase in the number of days where average outdoor temperatures exceed 40°C. For high-tech greenhouses growing cucumbers—a crop whose optimal temperature is well below 40°C—this will result in substantially higher energy costs to maintain the environment needed for crop productivity. Greenhouses will require longer and more frequent use of cooling systems, especially during summer, with energy demand increasing non-linearly as outside temperatures rise above the crop’s stress threshold. This escalation in cooling needs directly impacts operational costs and may pose financial sustainability challenges unless energy use is mitigated by improved technology or management.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The rise in extreme temperature days directly elevates cooling costs for cucumber greenhouses, as cucumber growth is optimal below 32°C and ceases to be productive beyond 38°C.\n- This information is critical for investors, growers, and policymakers in the UAE’s agriculture sector, as it highlights the heightened financial and technical demands that climate change will exert on protected cultivation systems.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Cucumber growth is best below 32°C; above 38°C, stress and yield loss increase | ECOCROP: Optimal max 32°C, absolute max 38°C for Cucumis sativus | ECOCROP |\n| 2 | By 2040, monthly mean temps in Dubai reach up to ~37°C in Aug/Sep; increase from 2020s | Model data: nextGEMS, 2040-2049 simulations for 25.2048, 55.2708 | nextGEMS model dataset |\n| 3 | More days above 40°C escalate cooling needs and costs for greenhouses | Greenhouse climate management principles; secondary agronomic sources | Wikipedia, ECOCROP |\n| 4 | No direct quantification of the number of >40°C days or cooling energy increase in peer-reviewed sources | N/A | N/A |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- ECOCROP and nextGEMS datasets are internationally recognized, model-based resources for crop-climate and climate forecasting.\n- Wikipedia and expert agronomic knowledge supplement the analysis but are secondary sources.\n- No local peer-reviewed quantification of the exact increase in >40°C days or corresponding energy costs.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe main uncertainties in this assessment stem from the lack of exact quantification of days above 40°C and their direct translation into specific energy cost increases. Climate model projections contain uncertainties related to emissions, local microclimates, and urban heat amplification. The effect on greenhouse energy bills will also depend on yet-unknown advances in cooling, insulation, and climate-adaptive greenhouse designs, as well as potential changes in energy pricing. Thus, while the trend toward higher energy requirements is robust, exact cost increments and adaptation potential are not fully predictable with current data.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Upgrade or design greenhouses with highly efficient and climate-resilient cooling technologies (such as evaporative cooling, thermal screens, or renewable energy integration) to minimize the impact of escalating heat.\n2. Commission local studies and scenario analyses to precisely forecast the number of >40°C days and resulting energy demands, supporting targeted infrastructure investments and strategic crop planning.\n\n---",
