  "QuestionText": "How might climate change impact the viability and seasonality of tourism in the Caribbean by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2040, tourism viability and seasonality in Pont Cassé, Dominica—reflective of broader Caribbean trends—will be increasingly shaped by climate change. The main climate concerns for tourism are hotter dry seasons, the likelihood of more frequent and disruptive multi-day rain events, and persistent risk of very long wet spells. Monthly temperature highs between May and July are projected to reach 34–38°C, raising the risk of heat stress for visitors and staff. The wet (hurricane) season, from August to October, is expected to experience both more frequent short rain disruptions and the continuing possibility of prolonged wet periods lasting several weeks, which could force cancellations of outdoor activities or damage tourism infrastructure. However, the underlying variability means some years may be far more affected than others.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- **Rising temperatures in key tourist months** may make outdoor activities uncomfortable or unsafe, especially in early summer.\n- **Increased variability and risk of multi-day rainfall and hurricane events** threatens reliability of bookings, activities, and travel infrastructure.\n- **Essential for the tourism sector** to plan for year-to-year unpredictability and to invest in adaptation measures for both staff and visitors.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | By 2040, wet spell frequency increases to ~8.6 events/year (+8%) with high year-to-year variability | Multi-model ensemble projections, 2036–2050, CMIP6 HighResMIP | XCLIM-AI analysis, CMIP6 (7 models, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | Persistent maximum wet spells (up to 31 days) remain likely into the 2040s | Multi-model ensemble, 2036–2050 data | XCLIM-AI analysis, CMIP6 |\n| 3 | Annual temperature maxima between May–July to reach 34–38°C | Downscaled monthly mean climate projections for 2040s | Direct dataset extraction |\n| 4 | Non-significant statistical trend in wet spell metrics but high interannual variability | All p-values >0.1 in trend analysis | XCLIM-AI assessment |\n| 5 | Wikipedia has no direct quantitative data for these variables in the tourism context | No relevant data available | Wikipedia search |\n| 6 | No crop-specific or tourism-requirement thresholds from ECOCROP applicable to tourism suitability | N/A | ECOCROP search |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Climate projections are model-based and derived from the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble, a leading peer-reviewed international climate modeling collaboration.\n- Rainfall and temperature data are downscaled and highly relevant for regional and local decision-making, though not peer-reviewed specifically for local tourism.\n- No direct, quantitative peer-reviewed studies linking these exact climate indicators to local tourism viability, but meteorological parameters are robust.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThere is moderate uncertainty in the projections due to natural year-to-year climate variability and differences between individual climate models, especially regarding precipitation. While a general warming trend is certain, the number and intensity of extended wet spells remain highly unpredictable, as indicated by non-significant trends and high variability across model runs. Furthermore, no data is available on local thresholds for tourism comfort (e.g., the number of \"unsafe heat\" or \"rainout\" days), making any direct assessment of how many days will be \"lost\" to climate impacts necessarily approximate. Thus, conclusions point to the likelihood of greater disruption, not precise forecasts for specific years.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Tourism operators and planners in Dominica should develop adaptive, flexible scheduling and contingency plans, recognizing the potential for both hotter peak seasons (May–July) and disruptive rain episodes, especially from August to October. Consider investing in shade, cooling features, rain shelters, and robust cancellation policies.\n2. Authorities and businesses should strengthen early-warning systems for severe weather and promote “climate-resilient” tourism infrastructure to mitigate the impact of extreme wet spells and protect visitor safety.\n\n---",
