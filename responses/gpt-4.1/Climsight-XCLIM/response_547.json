  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate change influence the burden of disease in Central Asian nations over the next 20 to 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nOver the next 20–30 years, climate change will increase the burden of vector-, water-, and heat-related diseases in Central Asia through hotter, longer summers and intensified extreme weather, most notably in and around Tashkent.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nTashkent and broader Central Asia are projected to experience hotter, longer summers (summer temperatures rising by 1.1–1.9°C), an increase in extreme heat days (annual days ≥35°C climbing from 41.6 to 66.7 by 2050), and shifting rainfall extremes. Higher temperatures and altered precipitation will expand the range and seasonality of disease-carrying vectors (mosquitoes, ticks), escalating risks of malaria, dengue, and tick-borne illnesses. Water-borne diseases and heat stress will also rise, particularly impacting vulnerable urban populations. Without adaptation, disease incidence and health-system strain will worsen; cross-sector surveillance and heat-health action plans are critical to mitigate these growing climatic risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Extreme heat days will sharply rise | Days over 35°C increase from 41.6 (historic) to 66.7 (2040–2050) annually | XCLIM_AI (CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble) | Numeric |\n| 2 | Summer mean temperatures will rise significantly | June–August means increase by 1.1–1.9°C by 2040–2049 | Atmospheric model simulations for Tashkent; XCLIM_AI | Numeric |\n| 3 | Vector-borne disease risk is strongly tied to higher temperatures | Regional/global literature links warmer, longer warm seasons to expanded mosquito and tick habitat and infection season | Wikipedia RAG_search; Climate-disease reviews | Citation/Text |\n| 4 | Water- and heat-related illnesses will escalate | Combined heat stress and hydrological extremes amplify risk for water-borne disease and heat stress, especially in cities | Wikipedia; XCLIM_AI | Text |\n| 5 | Climate projections detail local seasonality shifts | Tashkent monthly data: August mean temperature up to 36.06°C and near-zero summer rainfall by 2040s | Provided model output | Numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on high emissions (CMIP6 SSP5-8.5), with actual risks depending on global/region-wide mitigation and adaptation.\n- Data limitations: Lacks localized epidemiological trend data and detail on health system response capacities.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in heating/extreme event projections; moderate confidence for specific disease increases due to adaptive factors.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Expand heat-health action plans and public early warning systems ahead of and during extreme summer events, with special focus on children, elderly, and outdoor workers.\n2. Enhance vector surveillance and integrated climate-health monitoring, including cooperation between health, meteorological, and urban planning sectors to adapt water supply, sanitation, and disease control strategies.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Vector-borne”: Diseases that are spread by animals such as mosquitoes or ticks.\n- “CMIP6 HighResMIP”: A set of international climate models used to predict future temperature and precipitation changes under scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions.",
