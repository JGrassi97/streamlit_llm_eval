  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected impact of climate change on energy infrastructure resilience in coastal Louisiana, USA, over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change will increase heat and extreme weather risks for energy infrastructure in coastal Louisiana, leading to longer, hotter seasons, unstable precipitation, and continued flood and hurricane threats, necessitating urgent resilience upgrades.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next two decades, coastal Louisiana's energy infrastructure will face greater resilience challenges due to climate change. Summers will arrive up to 2.5 weeks earlier, with sustained high temperatures placing stress on grid reliability and increasing cooling demand. While total annual precipitation remains steady, year-to-year variability means both flood and drought risk persist, particularly impacting transmission, distribution, and generation assets. The continued threat of hurricanes and extreme storms, paired with shifting seasonal patterns, underscores the importance of recently funded adaptation projects (e.g., flood mitigation, microgrids). Action is needed now to update operational protocols, reinforce flood and wind protections, and enhance infrastructure redundancy to address evolving hazards.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Summers will start ~2.5 weeks earlier by 2050, increasing peak cooling stress and grid loads. | First sustained ≥25°C spell advances from May 16 (1981–2020) to April 29 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP, XCLIM_AI climate indicators | Numeric |\n| 2 | Annual precipitation remains stable but highly variable, keeping flood/drought risks elevated. | Mean 1244–1263 mm/year, std >10% of mean; no trend, high interannual swings | CMIP6 HighResMIP, XCLIM_AI | Numeric |\n| 3 | Extreme winds, hurricanes, and flooding remain core threats, requiring infrastructure adaptation. | Ongoing hurricane landfalls, $7B FEMA resilience funding, over 100 local adaptation projects | Wikipedia Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, XCLIM_AI | Citation/text |\n| 4 | Grid/conductor heat stress, flood, and wind threats to substations and lines all projected to rise. | Model-based review of temperature, precipitation, qualitative wind/flood risk | XCLIM_AI, RAG_search, Wikipedia | Numeric/text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on CMIP6 high-emissions (SSP5-8.5); outcomes may differ under lower-emissions pathways.  \n- Data limitations: Wind extremes not explicitly modeled; regional hurricane landfall frequency inherently uncertain.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in earlier, hotter summers; moderate for precipitation variability; moderate for extreme event future frequency.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Accelerate flood, wind, and heat-hardening projects for substations, conductors, and generation sites with FEMA/IIJA funds.\n2. Update operational planning for earlier, longer periods of peak grid stress; deploy microgrids and backup systems in hazard-prone zones.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Peak load” refers to the highest electricity demand a grid faces, typically during heatwaves.\n- “SSP5-8.5” is a high-emissions climate model scenario, indicating significant future warming without strong mitigation.",
