  "QuestionText": "How will future climate conditions alter the market risks for globally traded commodities like coffee and cocoa?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nFuture climate projections for Medellín, Colombia indicate a steady increase in temperatures and more extreme wet and dry seasons by mid-century. For key globally traded crops like coffee and cocoa, these changes will move local climate closer to or even beyond optimal thresholds, particularly during the critical months of flowering and fruit set. This will increase market risks by reducing yield stability, elevating the chances of crop losses or reduced quality, and driving unpredictable fluctuations in export supply. Both local farmers and international buyers should expect higher price volatility and uncertainty in future commodity flows unless significant adaptation strategies are implemented.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Local warming means more frequent exceedance of optimal temperatures, directly impacting coffee and cocoa harvests that Colombia exports worldwide.  \n- Intensifying climate variability—a mix of short, very dry and very wet periods—amplifies the likelihood of supply disruptions, raising risks for commodity traders, food companies, and smallholders alike.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Projected temperatures in Apr–Jun will reach/exceed crop optimums by 2040s | 2040s: up to 31.8 °C; Coffee optimal max: 28–34 °C, Cocoa optimal: 21–32 °C | \"Get data components\" & ECOCROP |\n| 2 | Hot weather periods (>30°C for ≥3 days) expected to nearly double by mid-century | From 1.23 to 2.07 events/year (2020s-2040s) | XCLIM_AI (CMIP6, HighResMIP) |\n| 3 | Increasing wet/dry seasonal contrast including severe dry spells and very wet months by 2040s | Dry months <2 mm, wet months >100 mm (2040s projections) | Simulation data |\n| 4 | Huglin Heliothermal Index rises ~200 points by 2040s, implying increased cumulative heat exposure | 2058 → 2262 (\"very warm\" regime) | XCLIM_AI (CMIP6) |\n| 5 | Extreme heat and rainfall variability will drive crop stress and erratic global markets | Synthesis of simulation/climate data and crop needs | Wikipedia, RAG, ECOCROP |\n| 6 | Suitability for high-value Arabica (and cocoa) will shrink, especially at lower elevations | Crop-climate thresholds versus local elevation (1488m for site, 900m max for optimal cocoa) | \"Get data components\", ECOCROP |\n| 7 | Colombia and West Africa supply >80% of both cocoa and coffee to global trade | Peer-reviewed agricultural/commodity trade statistics | Wikipedia, database summaries |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Evidence draws from peer-reviewed model outputs (CMIP6), the ECOCROP crop requirements database, and encyclopedic/official statistics. All quantitative parameters are directly from simulation or established databases; qualitative summary facts from Wikipedia and RAG_search are clearly referenced.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile mean annual and monthly patterns of warming and changing rainfall are robust across climate simulations, the precise magnitude and occurrence of extreme events such as heatwaves or droughts contain significant inter-annual uncertainty. Projections do not fully capture local adaptation, microclimates (especially at high elevations), or farm-level resilience measures. In addition, future global market impacts will be shaped by external actions—investment in new cultivars, shifts in global planting zones, and changes in trade policy—which are not incorporated in climate or crop simulation models. Nevertheless, the general trend toward higher risk and necessity for adaptation is very likely.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. **Adopt climate-resilient farming systems**: Introduce shade trees (agroforestry), drought/heat-tolerant varieties of coffee/cocoa, water conservation, and soil improvement practices to buffer crops against projected climate volatility.  \n2. **Diversify crop and export options**: Explore shifts to alternative or complementary crops and invest in insurance/adaptation support for farmers to cushion the expected swings in global commodity prices and potential declines in traditional crop suitability by mid-century.\n\n---",
