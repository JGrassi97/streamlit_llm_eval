  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate variability impact sovereign credit risk for nations heavily dependent on agriculture in Central America by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2040, heightened climate variability will drive more frequent agricultural shortfalls—especially in staple crops like maize—increasing fiscal stress and sovereign credit risk for agriculture-dependent Central American countries.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected changes for Central America, exemplified by Guatemala City, include hotter temperatures (increases up to +1.9°C seasonally) and notably volatile rainfall patterns, with longer dry spells and pronounced wet season fluctuations by 2040. Although mean annual precipitation often remains marginally within maize’s tolerance, years with extended droughts and erratic rainfall will become recurrent, periodically undermining crop yields. This recurring agricultural volatility can lower GDP, shrink government revenues, boost food import bills, and amplifies sovereign credit risk through both reduced economic stability and higher fiscal burdens. Without timely adaptation, these countries face rising borrowing costs and greater financial vulnerability tied directly to climate.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | By 2040, dry spells longer than 30 consecutive days and variable wet/dry extremes will increase crop failure risk in Guatemala | Projected max annual dry spell = 31.7 ± 5.2 days; seasonal rainfall varies, at times near maize threshold (min. 1200 mm) | CMIP6 HighResMIP, nextGEMS 2040s, ECOCROP for maize | Numeric/Model |\n| 2 | Maize requires ~600–1200 mm rainfall/year, but climate projections show some years will fall near or below optimal, supporting future volatility | ECOCROP: Maize optimal rainfall 600–1200 mm; nextGEMS 2040s shows years with ~1200 mm and longer dry seasons | ECOCROP, nextGEMS | Numeric |\n| 3 | Crop shocks in agriculture-dependent states will increase sovereign credit risk and affect fiscal health | Extreme dry/wet events, higher food import bills, government spending on disasters, export reduction | Wikipedia (Climate Change impacts), RAG synthesis | Textual/Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on high-emissions CMIP6/nextGEMS model means; localized extremes may be higher than ensemble average.\n- Data limitations: Some datasets for local, sub-annual precipitation extremes or detailed economic impacts not provided.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction of increased risk; moderate confidence on exact magnitude and frequency of economic impact.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Embed climate shock stress-testing in national credit risk and fiscal planning models, using local drought/flood indices.  \n2. Expand investment in drought-resistant crops and rural insurance to buffer macroeconomic volatility.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “CMIP6/nextGEMS” are collections of climate models that simulate future weather/climate scenarios; “ensemble mean” is their statistical average.\n- “Sovereign credit risk” means a country’s likelihood of defaulting on its debt; increasing risk usually leads to higher interest rates (borrowing costs).\n\n",
