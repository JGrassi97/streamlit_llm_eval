  "QuestionText": "How will future climate scenarios influence investment risk in the tourism sector of the Caribbean islands by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nFuture climate scenarios indicate that investment risk in the tourism sector of Liberta, Saint Paul, Antigua and Barbuda, will increase by 2035, primarily due to the rising intensity and variability of rainfall events and persistent regional climate hazards. The most significant challenge for tourism infrastructure comes from the expected +24% increase in extreme single-day rainfall (to around 80 mm, with outlier events possibly as high as 149 mm), which heightens the risk of flooding and property damage. Although the number of days above critical heat thresholds (>32°C) will remain very low, overall warmer temperatures (with summer peaks nearing 38°C in the 2040s) and episodic hurricanes will threaten service continuity, increase infrastructure maintenance costs, and elevate insurance premiums. Sea level rise, while not an imminent threat at 67 m elevation for this inland location, will continue to impact island access routes, the broader hospitality economy, and coastal assets. Therefore, climate-resilient investments—especially flood mitigation and storm-proof construction—will be essential to safeguard returns in the tourism sector.\n\n**Key relevance points:**  \n- The sharp rise in extreme rainfall events directly increases infrastructure and operational risks for tourism, potentially leading to greater maintenance and insurance costs and service disruption.\n- Effective investment in adaptation measures is vital for business continuity and the economic sustainability of tourism, which forms a large part of the local and national economy.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table:**  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Extreme daily rainfall (+24%) projected by 2035 | CMIP6 HighResMIP simulations (RX1day index: ~65 mm historical to ~80 mm 2035, possible outliers up to 149 mm/day) | XCLIM_AI, CMIP6 HighResMIP |\n| 2 | Minimal increase in heat days >32°C; overall mean temperature rising | CMIP6 ensemble (summer months up to 37–38°C, but acute thresholds rarely crossed) | XCLIM_AI, CMIP6 HighResMIP |\n| 3 | Sea level rise & hurricanes remain major regional risks to coastal and tourism assets | Synthesis of projections and assessments | Wikipedia: Climate change in the Caribbean; RAG_search, regional studies |\n| 4 | Hurricane damages expected to total 11–17% of Caribbean GDP annually | Economic analyses cited in Wikipedia | Wikipedia: Climate change in the Caribbean |\n| 5 | Increased rainfall event variability and flood risk | Model spread and qualitative expert analysis | XCLIM_AI, Wikipedia |\n| 6 | Tourism remains vulnerable to disruption from storms, droughts, cascading hazards | Regional synthesis | CMIP6 projections, Wikipedia |\n| 7 | Local elevation (67 m) reduces direct sea level risk for Liberta, but regional impacts persist | OSM; Wikipedia synthesis | OSM data; Wikipedia |\n\n**Source quality:**  \n- The CMIP6 HighResMIP datasets are peer-reviewed and widely accepted in the climate science community for regional risk assessment.\n- Wikipedia references aggregate scientific reviews, United Nations, and World Bank data.\n- Results are model-based and reflect multi-model, ensemble means, and recognized high variability for tropical systems.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe climate projections used here provide robust signals for increasing extreme rainfall hazards, but local outcomes are subject to high year-to-year variability and model limitations. The standard deviation in projected annual maximum daily rainfall is large (±29 mm for 2035), and rare extremes may still occur above modeled means. Tropical cyclone risk—crucial for tourism—is especially difficult to localize, with possible underestimation of the worst-case events at fine spatial scales. Additionally, compound events (e.g., consecutive storms causing cascading infrastructure failure) are not fully captured by current models. While the general trend of higher temperatures and more volatile precipitation is clear, the precise impacts on tourism operations in Liberta versus elsewhere in Antigua are less certain, warranting conservative, scenario-based planning.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Prioritize the development and retrofitting of tourism infrastructure with enhanced drainage, flood-proofing, and storm-resistant design, accounting for a significant increase in rainfall extremes and associated disruption risks.\n2. Implement adaptive management strategies—including dynamic contingency planning for acute weather events, diversified insurance coverage, and investment in water storage and supply resilience—to ensure continuity of tourism operations and minimize economic losses.\n\n---",
