  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will future climate scenarios influence investment risk in the tourism sector of the Caribbean islands by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2035, tourism investment risk in the Caribbean will rise due to frequent heat waves, continued flood/coastal hazards, and mounting pressure on cooling, water, and infrastructure reliability, even as dry high-season stability mostly persists.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nFuture climate scenarios for the Caribbean, including Liberta (Antigua), project a surge in heat waves from rare to multiple events per year by 2035, drastically increasing risks of heat stress among tourists and staff, higher energy costs, and possible disruptions or cancellations during hot periods. While rainfall seasonality and dry-season stability for peak tourism will largely remain, intensified rainfall and ongoing sea level rise pose continued threats to coastal infrastructure and flood resilience. Investment strategies must account for growing operational costs, insurability challenges, and the need for robust climate-adaptive infrastructure, with key risks concentrated in heat extremes and episodic severe storms.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heat wave risk rises sharply by 2035 | Mean heat wave events increase from ~0 to 0.47/year (2021–2035) and up to 2+/year (2036–2050); some years project >4 events | CMIP6 HighResMIP, XCLIM_AI | numeric |\n| 2 | Proportion of wet days remains stable (~39%) | No significant change in annual wet-day fraction; rainfall is seasonally concentrated | CMIP6 HighResMIP, XCLIM_AI | numeric |\n| 3 | Sea level rise and storms threaten coastal assets | Sea level rise of 0.3–1 m by 2050; storms, erosion, and flooding increasingly a risk | Wikipedia: Climate change in the Caribbean | citation |\n| 4 | Tourism and infrastructure risk are tightly coupled to climate variability | 25–35% of Caribbean GDP/large economic disruption/11–17% GDP at risk annually | Wikipedia: Climate change in the Caribbean | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: All projections based on high-emission SSP5‑8.5 scenario and seven-model CMIP6 ensemble; model spread accounted for, but lower emissions/mitigation pathways could soften impacts.\n- Data limitations: Storm/hurricane quantification not resolved in high granularity; heat wave impacts derived from temperature thresholds and not observed health or insurance data.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature/heat trend; moderate in precipitation (seasonality robust, extremes less so); high confidence in sea level rise threat.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Integrate heat wave resilience and cooling capacity upgrades into tourism developments and renovations now (e.g., shade, ventilation, air conditioning).\n2. Prioritize infrastructure elevation, flood risk management, and coastal setback planning for all new or renewed assets.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Wet-day proportion\": Fraction of days with 1 mm+ rain; indicates rainy/“off” season vs. dry/high season.\n- \"Heat wave\": Periods of ≥3 consecutive days with both daytime highs >30°C and nighttime lows >22°C.",
