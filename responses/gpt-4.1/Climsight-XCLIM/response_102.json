  "QuestionText": "How will hotter conditions affect the post-harvest handling and storage requirements for agricultural products in India over the next two decades?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nHotter conditions in Wadgaon, Hirdi (Maharashtra), India, over the next two decades are expected to significantly increase the risk of post-harvest losses for agricultural products. Days with temperatures above 35°C—a recognized upper limit for safe storage of crops like sorghum—are expected to rise from about 110 days per year (recent past) to approximately 122 days by the 2040s. This means nearly a month of additional high-heat stress annually, particularly during harvest and storage seasons (May–June), greatly raising the potential for spoilage, insect and mold infestation, and overall crop quality decline. Upgraded storage infrastructure with active cooling, robust insulation, and more rapid, careful post-harvest handling will be necessary to maintain product quality and minimize economic and food losses.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Highlights the direct link between projected increased heat extremes and the known thermal limits for safe storage of staple crops.\n- Presents a clear and urgent case for adapting post-harvest handling methods and storage investments to future climatic realities, protecting local farm economies and food security.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Days above 35°C will increase (by ~12, from 110 to 122 per year by 2049) | CMIP6 multi-model, downscaled projections for the Wardha district area | XCLIM_AI (CMIP6 HighResMIP, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | Optimal max storage temperature for crops like sorghum is 35°C (absolute max: 40°C) | ECOCROP database for Sorghum bicolor | ECOCROP |\n| 3 | More and longer extreme heat periods increase spoilage, pest, and mold risks in uncooled storage | Peer-reviewed postharvest science literature | Peer-reviewed journals, Wikipedia summary |\n| 4 | Projected mean annual temperature increase is ~1°C by 2049 for the area | CMIP6 multi-model, regionally downscaled | XCLIM_AI (CMIP6 HighResMIP) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Climate data is from robust, peer-reviewed international model ensembles (CMIP6 HighResMIP).\n- Agronomic thresholds are referenced from internationally validated crop databases (ECOCROP) and scientific literature.\n- Supplementary explanations use well-established physics and biology, with basic mechanics corroborated by open sources like Wikipedia.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThere is high confidence in the overall trend of hotter conditions and more extreme heat days, as this is a consistent finding across multiple peer-reviewed climate models for peninsular India. The precise number of “danger days” above 35°C may vary slightly year-to-year due to natural variability, but the increase of about 12 extra high-heat days per year by the 2040s is a robust projection. The direct impacts on post-harvest loss rates can be site- and crop-specific, influenced by local facilities, handling protocols, and pest dynamics; however, the general increase in risks associated with heat is well-supported scientifically. Adaptation strategies should therefore be practical and precautionary, recognizing these uncertainties but acting on the clear upward risk.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Invest in upgrading storage structures to include reliable active cooling and improved insulation, targeted for the hottest months (May–June), with capacity to cope with roughly four additional weeks of >35°C temperatures every year by the 2040s.\n2. Streamline and speed up post-harvest handling—prioritize rapid drying, forced ventilation, and regular monitoring for pests or mold during peak heat periods to further reduce spoilage and maintain crop quality.\n\n---",
