  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might projected climate changes alter insurance risk assessments in Rabat, Morocco over the next three decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nInsurance risk in Rabat will likely rise due to increased heat stress, higher drought and erratic precipitation risk, and persistent windstorm hazards, although no significant long-term trends in wind extremes are projected.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate projections for Rabat, Morocco, to 2050, indicate higher mean temperatures, especially in summer, more erratic and generally declining precipitation, and stable (though still significant) windstorm risk. Insurance assessments must account for rising heatwave frequency, increased drought and potential for sudden, localized floods due to precipitation variability, and continued risk from extreme wind events. Wind extremes are not projected to worsen overall, but hazardous high-wind years will occur. Insurers should prepare for more frequent, severe, and compound climate-related claims, particularly in health, agriculture, and property lines, and should reconsider coverage terms, reinsurance, and risk zoning. \n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Summer temperatures rise, increasing heat-related risk | July–September mean: from 27.5–30.9°C (2020s) to 29.1–32.9°C (2040s) | CMIP6 HighResMIP (2024), XCLIM_AI | Numeric |\n| 2 | Annual max wind speeds remain mostly stable, but extreme wind years still occur | Historic: 40.0 m/s; 2036–2050: 36.78 m/s (no significant trend) | CMIP6 HighResMIP, XCLIM_AI | Numeric |\n| 3 | Precipitation becomes more erratic, amplifying drought and flood risks | Summer monthly totals <5mm; higher unpredictability in wet months | ClimSight, XCLIM_AI | Numeric |\n| 4 | Insurance risks for heat, wind, flood, and drought are increasing overall | Analysis of risk factors (heat stress, wind, erratic rainfall) | Wikipedia (“Climate risk insurance”), RAG_search | Citation/text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on CMIP6 multi-model mean, mostly SSP5-8.5 (high emissions); local extremes may exceed projections.\n- Data limitations: Precipitation and wind extremes may be underrepresented by coarse-resolution models; subgrid variability/compound events not fully captured.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in warming and erratic precipitation; moderate confidence for unchanged wind hazard envelope; lower confidence for rare extreme events.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Update catastrophe models and risk zoning to reflect higher summer heat and more variable precipitation, especially for property and health insurance lines.\n2. Maintain robust windstorm reinsurance and review aggregation risk for simultaneous heat, drought, and wind loss events.\n3. Engage in customer education and risk mitigation measures, e.g., promote resilient building and early warning systems.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Diurnal temperature range” refers to the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperatures; greater variability can affect cooling/heating needs and stress risk.\n- “Reinsurance” is insurance purchased by insurers to protect against large-scale or catastrophic losses.\n\n",
