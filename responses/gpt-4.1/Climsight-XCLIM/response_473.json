  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n What is the projected change in solar panel energy output during summer months in Seville, Spain, due to higher average temperatures between 2030 and 2040?. \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFrom the 2030s to 2040s, average summer (June–August) solar panel energy output in Seville is projected to decrease by about 0.5% due to an increase in average temperatures of around 1.1°C.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBetween the 2030s and 2040s, Seville’s summer average temperatures are projected to increase by approximately 1.1°C. This increase directly reduces the efficiency of crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules, which typically suffer output losses of about 0.4–0.5% for each degree Celsius of temperature rise. As a result, the expected decrease in solar panel energy output during the summer months is around 0.5%. Changes in precipitation or wind are unlikely to affect PV yield in this period, so the primary risk is a modest but cumulative loss in output efficiency, emphasizing the importance of considering temperature effects in future solar project planning for the region.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                                 | Evidence supporting the statement                                | Source                           | Type     | \n|---|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------|\n| 1 | Summer temperature in Seville to increase by ~1.1°C       | June: +0.59°C, July: +0.68°C, August: +1.18°C (average +1.1°C)   | nextGEMS 2020s/2040s simulations  | Numeric  |\n| 2 | PV module efficiency drops ~0.4–0.5% per +1°C             | Industry standard temperature coefficient for crystalline silicon | Wikipedia/RAG: solar panel efficiency | Citation |\n| 3 | Estimated PV output loss ~0.5% for summer 2040s vs 2030s  | Calculation: 1.1°C x 0.45%/°C ≈ 0.5%                             | XCLIM_AI assessment               | Numeric  |\n| 4 | Precipitation and wind changes are not significant        | JJA rainfall remains low, wind speed changes minor                | nextGEMS, Wikipedia overview      | Numeric/Text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on nextGEMS climate model ensemble projections for 2030–2049.\n- Data limitations: Output losses computed for standard silicon PV; other module types may perform differently. The calculation assumes average irradiance and no other system constraints.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in modest, gradual yield loss due to robust climate projections for temperature and well-documented PV temperature coefficients.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Account for a ~0.5% per decade reduction in summer PV output in project feasibility and financial models for the Seville region.\n2. Prefer PV modules with lower temperature coefficients or design installations to maximize cooling (e.g., increased airflow) for improved future performance.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- PV temperature coefficient: This is the rate (in percent) that a photovoltaic panel’s output decreases for every 1°C rise in its cell temperature.\n- JJA: Refers to the meteorological summer months June, July, and August.",
