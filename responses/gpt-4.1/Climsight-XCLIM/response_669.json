  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat impact might expected temperature changes have on energy demand in Cairo, Egypt over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures will likely increase Cairo’s annual and summer peak energy demand for cooling by at least 17% by 2050, especially in June–September.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected temperature rise in Cairo (+1.6 °C by 2050) will drive a 17% increase in cooling degree days (CDD), meaning much higher energy demand for air conditioning, especially during already-hot summer months. Since cooling currently represents about 60% of Egypt’s peak load, electricity systems will be stressed by frequent and more intense heat waves with average monthly temperatures exceeding 33–35 °C by the 2040s. With negligible rainfall to moderate temperatures, without improvements in building or cooling system efficiency, annual and peak demand for cooling will climb sharply, requiring robust adaptation in electricity supply, urban planning, and heat management.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Annual and summer peak energy demand will rise by at least 17% by 2050 | Annual Cooling Degree Days (CDD) projected to increase from 2263 to 2655 K·days 1981–2050 (+17%) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble (SSP5‑8.5) | Numeric |\n| 2 | Air conditioning accounts for 60% of Egypt’s peak power demand | Stated in Wikipedia/engineering analyses on Egyptian buildings | Wikipedia: Windcatcher (summary) | Citation |\n| 3 | Mean monthly summer temperatures will exceed 33–35 °C by the 2040s | Monthly means reach 34–35 °C in July–September (climate projections, 2040s) | Dataset: Monthly Temperature, Cairo 2020–2049 | Numeric |\n| 4 | Precipitation is negligible, offering little moderating effect | Monthly means <4 mm and declining in hot months | Dataset: Monthly Precipitation, Cairo 2020–2049 | Numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Uses SSP5-8.5 “high emissions” scenario; lower emissions could reduce the increase.\n- Data limitations: Projections are multi-model means; actual peak demand will also depend on population growth, building efficiency, and AC adoption.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence (all models agree on direction and magnitude of warming/Cooling Degree Days rise for Cairo).\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in grid upgrades and expand summer cooling capacity to anticipate a ~17% rise in peak electricity demand.\n2. Strengthen building codes and incentivize efficient, passive cooling for new and existing structures to limit demand growth.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Cooling Degree Days (CDD)” measures how much temperatures exceed comfort levels—higher values mean more energy is needed for cooling.\n- “SSP5-8.5” is a climate scenario assuming high greenhouse gas emissions, often used for “business-as-usual” projections.",
