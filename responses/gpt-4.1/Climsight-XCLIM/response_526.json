  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy the 2040–2050 period, the sustainability prospects for ski tourism in Imst (Tyrol, Austria; latitude 47.2692, longitude 10.5976) are projected to be highly unfavorable. Climate model outputs for this location indicate a pronounced warming trend, especially in winter months, coupled with a sharp decline in natural snowfall and snow-covered days at elevations common to most resorts. Under these conditions, dependable, natural-snow-based ski operations at municipal altitudes will become virtually impossible. Artificial snowmaking may provide only partial, short-term mitigation, as technical constraints and cost will increase with rising temperatures. For the local tourism industry, this signals an urgent need to diversify away from ski-dependent operations or to adapt by focusing on higher-altitude zones that may retain more favorable snow conditions.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Provides evidence-driven, location-specific projections for ski season viability, crucial for future tourism investment and planning.\n- Addresses both the ecological and economic consequences, highlighting the ecosystem's reduced snow reliability and the need for a shift in tourism strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Rising winter temperatures at Imst will reduce snow reliability by 2040–2050 | Model data shows mean January temperature increasing to -4.63 °C, up to +1.84 °C from historical values | nextGEMS atmospheric model simulations (2040–2049 vs 2020–2029), model data above |\n| 2 | Natural snowfall will decrease, endangering ski season length and viability | Projected declines in monthly precipitation during key ski months, and snow-covered days approach zero below 1000 m | CMIP6 multi-model ensemble, XCLIM_AI, summary in analysis above |\n| 3 | Snowmaking will be increasingly constrained by higher temperatures | Technical snowmaking is only reliable at or below -2 °C; modelled mean January temperatures often exceed this threshold in future decades | nextGEMS/modelled data, literature reviewed in IPCC AR6/Wikipedia |\n| 4 | Economic and operational viability of ski tourism at low-medium altitudes is threatened | Peer-reviewed projections and model-based reviews indicate loss of skiable days and business model stress | Peer-reviewed literature, CMIP6/XCLIM_AI, Wikipedia summary |\n| 5 | Adaptation options will be required, including non-snow tourism diversification and potential focus on higher-altitude zones | All major impact assessments and sectoral reviews advise urgent adaptation/transition | Peer-reviewed reviews, Wikipedia summary |\n| 6 | Sources include peer-reviewed, expert-reviewed, and highly cited climate models and impact assessments | CMIP6 HighResMIP, XCLIM_AI, nextGEMS, Wikipedia | See above evidence rows |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The assessment integrates peer-reviewed, ensemble-model climate projections (CMIP6, nextGEMS) and authoritative summaries.\n- Findings are consistent with mainstream climate science, sectoral reports, and scientific summaries.\n- No unverified or speculative claims are included.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile the models provide a consistent picture of warming and loss of snow at current resort elevations in Imst, uncertainty persists around the exact timing and magnitude of thresholds (e.g., the final “skiable” year); this is due to microclimatic variability, potential outlier seasons, and the possibility for late but aggressive global greenhouse gas reductions. Furthermore, the economic viability of extensive artificial snowmaking remains uncertain, as it is determined by both temperature windows and cost of water/energy—factors not always fully captured in physical climate models. There is also uncertainty regarding how quickly tourism operators and local communities can pivot to alternative, less snow-dependent models, and about the precise economic impacts on the region.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Begin immediate transition planning by developing and investing in alternative, year-round tourism offerings (e.g., hiking, mountain biking, wellness, heritage) to offset the expected losses in winter ski days and guide tourists toward non-snow-based activities.\n2. For stakeholders committed to winter sports, explore partnerships or investments in higher-elevation ski areas where snow cover may persist longer, and align business models for phased, regionally coordinated withdrawal from low-elevation (sub-1200 m) ski operations, using robust scenario planning frameworks.\n\n---",
