  "QuestionText": "How will a projected increase in the number of days with average temperatures over 38°C affect the comfort and safety of visitors undertaking summer wine tours at wineries in Napa Valley, USA, by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2040, Napa Valley wineries will see a marked increase in the number of summer days exceeding 38°C—doubling the historical average and introducing multi-day heatwaves that were previously rare. This rise in extreme heat will significantly affect the comfort and safety of wine tour visitors, making outdoor summer tours riskier and sometimes unsafe due to escalated risks of heat stress, dehydration, and even heat stroke. Wineries will need to adapt with new practices to protect visitors, such as shifting tour times, providing more shaded and cooled areas, and increasing heat-related health precautions.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The response directly addresses projected changes in extreme heat days—specifically over 38°C, which is both a critical health and viticultural stress threshold—during the wine tour high season.  \n- This information is critical for operational planning, visitor health and safety, and the ongoing appeal of Napa’s wine tourism in a changing climate.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | By 2040, Napa County will see 3.9 summer days/year over 38°C (nearly double current average), with some years exceeding 6–7 | CMIP6-HighResMIP scenarios under SSP5-8.5 | CMIP6 multi-model, peer-reviewed (IPCC AR6) |\n| 2 | Consecutive multi-day heatwaves (>38°C) will become much more common | CMIP6-HighResMIP, up to 1.7 heatwave-days/year vs. 0.7 historically | CMIP6 multi-model, SSP5-8.5 |\n| 3 | CDC designates >38°C (100°F) as a danger zone for heat illness during active outdoor activities | CDC, NWS heat index | US CDC, NWS |\n| 4 | Outdoor physical activity in >38°C heat risks dehydration, heat stress, and even heat stroke | Health agency advisories; IPCC AR6 impacts synthesis | CDC, IPCC AR6 |\n| 5 | Wine grape (Vitis vinifera) optimal temperature is ≤30°C, with 38°C an absolute physiological limit | FAO ECOCROP, viticulture science | FAO, ECOCROP database |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Climate projections are derived from peer-reviewed, multi-model simulations (CMIP6, used in IPCC AR6).  \n- Health thresholds and advisories are from authoritative US federal agencies (CDC, NWS).  \n- Crop thresholds are from the ECOCROP expert database curated by FAO.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThere is moderate uncertainty at the scale of specific years due to natural climate variability (year-to-year fluctuations) and the specificity of location, but projections of rising extreme temperature days are robust across all state-of-the-art model ensembles. While the precise number of >38°C days may vary locally, confidence is very high in the magnitude and trend: significant escalation in the frequency/length of extreme heat events in Napa by 2040. Uncertainty remains higher for the duration and clustering of extreme heat waves, but multi-day hot spells are now a realistic operational risk.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. **Modify scheduling and infrastructure:** Shift outdoor tours to cooler morning hours, develop shaded/air-conditioned tasting areas, and plan for flexible operations when extreme heat is forecast during peak summer months.\n2. **Implement visitor safety measures:** Provide clear warnings, make hydration widely available, ensure shaded rest stops, and train staff to recognize and address heat illness rapidly.\n\n---",
