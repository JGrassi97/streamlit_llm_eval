  "QuestionText": "What is the potential financial impact of increased summer temperatures on the operating costs (e.g., cooling) for data centers located near Dublin, Ireland, over the next 20 years?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nRising summer temperatures in Dublin, driven by climate change over the next 20 years, are expected to significantly increase the operating costs associated with cooling for data centers. By the 2040s, the number of days exceeding 20°C is projected to double from 16 to 32 per summer, and cooling degree days above 18°C—a key metric for estimating cooling demand—are expected to rise by about 50%. For data center operators, this translates into a likely increase in annual cooling energy usage and costs by as much as 50%, unless substantial improvements in energy efficiency or cooling technology are implemented.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Projections indicate a consistent warming trend in Dublin summers, with notable increases in both peak and average temperatures during key cooling months (June–September).  \n- Cooling expenses, often representing a substantial share of facility energy spend (10–45% for many data centers), are especially vulnerable to these climatic shifts, narrowing the window for cost-saving passive cooling and requiring greater reliance on mechanical systems.  \n- For infrastructure, procurement, and budgeting, understanding the scale of escalation in cooling loads is critical to maintain competitiveness and grid reliability.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Days >20°C in summer will double by 2040–2049 | Projected increase from 16 to 32 days | XCLIM_AI/CMIP6 HighResMIP (7-model mean, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | Cooling degree days (CDD>18°C) will rise ~50% by mid-century | CDD>18°C to increase from 77→117 K·days/year | XCLIM_AI/CMIP6 HighResMIP |\n| 3 | Cooling costs could rise by up to 50% if efficiency remains unchanged | Based on proportional rise in CDD, which drives cooling energy use | XCLIM_AI, Wikipedia, CMIP6, industry literature |\n| 4 | Cooling energy now 10–45% of site energy in standard air-cooled centers | Sector overview | Wikipedia: Data center cooling |\n| 5 | Evidence is from peer-reviewed, multi-model, scenario-based sources | All climate projections are standard, international model outputs (CMIP6) | XCLIM_AI/CMIP6 HighResMIP |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Sources are peer-reviewed and expert-reviewed multi-model climate projections (CMIP6 HighResMIP) and widely-cited sectoral literature on data center energy use.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThese estimates are well-supported by multiple climate models and ensemble projections, providing high confidence in the general magnitude and direction of future temperature increases in the Dublin region. The main uncertainties concern future changes in electricity pricing, the pace of advances in data center cooling technology, possible shifts in data center operations (e.g., moving loads, adopting new architectures), and the frequency/severity of extreme heat events. Year-to-year variations in temperature may cause fluctuation in cooling costs, with heatwave years posing significant operational risks and potential for cost spikes above the averages reported.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Incorporate a projected 50% increase in summer cooling loads over the next 20 years into financial forecasts, procurement, and facility upgrade plans for all Dublin-area data centers, building in flexibility to adapt to potential peaks during extreme warm years.\n2. Accelerate investment in high-efficiency cooling systems, waste heat recovery, and/or modular design that can employ free cooling (when feasible), and consider scenario analysis around local electricity market and grid constraints to contain costs and sustain operational resilience.\n\n---",
