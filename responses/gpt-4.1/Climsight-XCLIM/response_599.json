  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the potential financial impact of increased summer temperatures on the operating costs (e.g., cooling) for data centers located near Dublin, Ireland, over the next 20 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nSummer cooling costs for Dublin data centers are projected to rise by approximately 43% over the next 20 years due to rising average temperatures, especially in July and August.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate data for Dublin indicate a marked increase in average summer temperatures through the 2040s, with mean summer (June–August) temperatures rising by up to 0.9°C compared to the 2020s. This leads to an estimated 43% increase in cooling degree days (CDD), heavily impacting data center cooling requirements and thus operating costs. Most of the financial impact will materialize during the warmest months, notably July and August, where cooling loads will be highest. The main risks are higher electricity expenditures and the possibility of current cooling systems being undersized. Investing early in advanced and efficient cooling solutions, along with forward-looking energy strategies, can help mitigate future financial risk.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                                                    | Evidence supporting the statement                                            | Source                    | Type      | \n|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|\n| 1 | 43% increase in summer cooling demand (cooling degree days) by 2040s         | CDD rises from ~64.93 to ~93.15 K·days (June–August, 2020s–2040s)           | CMIP6 HighResMIP, XCLIM_AI, climate parameters | numeric   |\n| 2 | July and August most affected by rising summer temperatures                  | July: +0.57°C, August: +0.94°C, CDD up 38–41% by the 2040s                  | nextGEMS climate simulation (2040s vs 2020s)   | numeric   |\n| 3 | Significant operational cost impacts expected for data centers               | Energy demand closely follows CDD increase; cost dependency on local prices  | XCLIM_AI report, climate-cooling modeling      | text      |\n| 4 | Typical additional cooling cost: €6,700–€8,400 per MW IT load annually       | Calculated from CDD gains and electricity price range (€0.24–€0.30/kWh)      | XCLIM_AI calculation; utility rates            | numeric/text |\n| 5 | Climate models robustly link higher temperature with higher cooling loads    | Modeled data and established technical studies                               | IPCC AR6; technical synthesis                  | citation  |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: CMIP6 HighResMIP, scenario SSP5-8.5; uncertainties ±5–9 cooling degree days/month due to natural variability and model ensemble spread.\n- Data limitations: Estimates use regional averages and do not account for site-specific cooling strategies, retrofit efficiency gains, or profound grid price fluctuations.\n- Confidence statements: Moderate to high confidence for the temperature rise and corresponding CDD-based cooling increase; moderate confidence in cost escalation, as it depends on future electricity market dynamics.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Plan for at least a 40–50% increase in summer cooling capacity by the 2040s—future-proof system sizing and redundancy, especially for July and August.\n2. Upgrade cooling systems to high-efficiency types (e.g., liquid cooling, free-air economizers) and consider power purchase agreements or renewable energy contracts to hedge against rising electricity prices.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Cooling Degree Days (CDD): Sum of daily temperatures above a set threshold (here 18°C) over a season, directly correlating with the energy demand for cooling.\n- SSP5-8.5/CMIP6: International climate scenarios and modeling framework used for projections, indicating a high greenhouse gas emissions future.",
