  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will changing climate patterns affect the potential for renewable energy generation across the Iberian Peninsula by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2040, climate change will enhance solar energy potential but reduce hydropower yields and leave wind energy potential mostly unchanged across the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, the Iberian Peninsula, including Madrid, is projected to experience rising annual temperatures (about +1 to +2°C) and a marked reduction in summer and autumn precipitation, according to high-resolution climate models. This will lead to a higher number of hot, sunny days, boosting solar photovoltaic (PV) potential but somewhat offset by PV efficiency losses during heatwaves. Declining rainfall and more frequent droughts will undermine hydropower reliability, especially in already dry months, while wind energy resources are forecast to experience only minor variation in average speeds and extreme events. Strategic adaptation—incorporating solar-friendly design, wind investment, and contingency planning for hydroelectricity—will be essential to maximize resilience and renewable supply in the region.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement                                         | Source                      | Type          |\n|---|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|\n| 1 | Solar potential will rise due to more hot and sunny days by 2040                     | Days >25°C rise from 109.3 to 130.3/year | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble, local models | Numeric       |\n| 2 | Significant decrease in precipitation during summer and autumn                       | Precipitation drops to 3.06 mm/month (Aug 2040s) | Downscaled local data (nextGEMS, 2040-49 projection)   | Numeric       |\n| 3 | Wind energy resource remains broadly stable with only limited change in speeds       | Wind speed changes typically <0.5 m/s versus 2020s | nextGEMS, 2040-49 compared to historical  | Numeric       |\n| 4 | Hydropower faces heightened risk from declining precipitation and higher evaporation | Precipitation declines especially in key seasonal months | nextGEMS, 2040-49 | Numeric/Text  |\n| 5 | PV efficiency penalty estimated at −0.4% per °C above 25°C                           | ~20 extra days/year with derating exposure | Typical PV guidelines, XCLIM_AI | Numeric/Text  |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: CMIP6 HighResMIP scenario (SSP5-8.5 high emissions); modeled at local resolution (Madrid data representative of continental conditions).\n- Data limitations: Fine-scale local effects, microclimates, and technology adaptation (e.g., improved PV cooling) are not directly represented; hydropower impacts depend on management strategies and basin specifics.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature increases and PV opportunity; moderate confidence in precipitation changes and hydropower risk; moderate-to-high confidence for stable wind energy outlook.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize deployment of solar PV systems that include heat-mitigating features (e.g., panel shading, passive or active cooling) to maximize yields during increasingly hot summers.\n2. Investigate diversification of the renewable portfolio, emphasizing continued wind resource exploitation, and invest in adaptive approaches to buffer hydroelectric output during dry periods (e.g., pumped storage, flexible grid integration).\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “PV derating” means the loss in solar panel efficiency as panel temperatures rise above standard conditions.\n- “Wind speed (m/s)” is the velocity of wind measured in meters per second, affecting wind turbines’ output. \n- Precipitation “mm/month” refers to the total rainfall in millimeters over each month; important for hydropower.",
