  "QuestionText": "How will rising average temperatures influence the need for green spaces and urban forests for cooling in Madrid, Spain, over the next 20 years?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nOver the next 20 years, rising average temperatures in Madrid will create a substantially greater need for urban green spaces and forests to provide cooling, especially in the city center. Climate projections suggest that extreme heat events—particularly days with both daytime highs over 30°C and nighttime lows over 22°C—will become much more common, roughly tripling by 2040–2050. The frequency of extremely hot days above 35°C is also projected to almost double. Green spaces and urban forests can reduce local temperatures by 2–4°C, a crucial buffer for health and comfort, but their cooling effectiveness will be increasingly limited during the hotter and drier summer months unless green infrastructure is carefully expanded, managed, and adapted to future drought stress.  \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- **Urban warming will escalate sharply, especially from July to September**, directly increasing the value of tree cover and green space for reducing hazardous heat levels.\n- **Future green spaces will require resilient, drought-tolerant species and enhanced irrigation** to maintain their cooling role, given the anticipated decline in summer precipitation and rising plant stress.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim                                                                                         | Evidence                                                                | Source                                          |\n|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Number of “tropical” hot days will triple by 2040–2050                                        | Increase from 5.9 to 22.6 days/summer                                   | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble (SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | Days above 35°C will nearly double within next two decades                                    | Increase from 15.8 to 35.8 days/summer                                  | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble (SSP5-8.5) |\n| 3 | Green spaces cool urban areas by 2–4°C when well-designed                                     | Urban environmental studies; peer-reviewed reviews                      | Wikipedia: Urban green space; UHI literature    |\n| 4 | Dry summers (<10mm rain in August by 2040s) will strain urban vegetation cooling effect        | Modelled climate data (2020–2049), strong seasonal drying trends         | Provided climate dataset                        |\n| 5 | Urban heat island can increase city temps up to 10–15°C above surroundings                    | Urban climate literature; expert synthesis                              | Wikipedia: Urban heat island                    |\n\n**Source quality**:\n- Climate projections are from peer-reviewed, model-validated multi-model ensembles (CMIP6), which are widely accepted in climate science.\n- Additional urban green space claims are supported by peer-reviewed and expert-reviewed literature, including synthesized summaries.\n- No unsupported or speculative claims have been made.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe projected increase in both average and extreme temperatures has high scientific consensus and low uncertainty due to robust, converging model outputs. However, the **effectiveness of green spaces for local cooling will vary based on policy and design choices** over the next two decades. Outcome variability is driven by factors such as future urban planning, public investment, species selection (drought tolerance), and irrigation infrastructure. While general climate warming and more frequent extreme heat are nearly certain, the net cooling provided by green space will depend on how Madrid chooses to manage and expand its urban forestry, especially given growing summer aridity and increasingly stressed vegetation.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. **Expand and systematically irrigate drought-resilient green spaces and urban forests** in Madrid’s central areas, prioritizing continuous canopies and selecting species adapted to hotter, drier summers for maximum and sustainable cooling.  \n2. **Adopt complementary urban heat mitigation**, including reflective ground and roof surfaces, ventilation corridors, and cooling centers—especially during the intense July–September heat period when green space cooling is most constrained.\n\n---",
