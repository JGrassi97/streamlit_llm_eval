  "QuestionText": "How will a reduction in the number of months with average temperatures below freezing affect the viability of the ski industry in the Pyrenees near Andorra by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2040, reliable months with average temperatures below freezing in Andorra’s Pyrenees are projected to shrink to just January and February, compared to a historical norm of December through March. This marked reduction will significantly shorten and destabilize the region’s ski season, concentrating viable operations into a narrow mid-winter window. The implications are severe for both natural snowfall and the feasibility of artificial snowmaking, particularly below the highest elevations. As a direct result, the traditional ski industry model in the region faces high risk, with critical challenges for business planning, infrastructure investment, and mountain ecosystem stability.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The number of consistently subzero months is directly tied to natural and manufactured snow cover—the foundation of ski tourism.\n- These changes threaten the economic viability of ski resorts, as well as community and environmental resilience in the Andorran Pyrenees.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | By 2040, only Jan–Feb maintain mean temperatures below 0°C, down from Dec–Mar. | 2040–2049 model data: Jan (0.0°C), Feb (–0.65°C); Dec and Mar above freezing. | nextGEMS pre-final simulations 2040x |\n| 2 | Annual subzero days, especially for ski season, projected to fall (e.g., Dec–Mar). | ~175 days/year with Tmin < 0°C projected (down from ~223). | XCLIM_AI/CMIP6, 2024 |\n| 3 | Viable ski season shifts to a ~2-month window; late-autumn/early-spring are increasingly unreliable. | Delay in first subzero day to mid-late Nov; March & December mean temperatures above 0°C. | XCLIM_AI models, 2024 |\n| 4 | Reduced snow reliability at lower/mid-elevations; snow line moves up. | Peer-reviewed synthesis and Wikipedia summary: “Number of days with enough snow for skiing is declining, and snow line is retreating to higher altitudes.” | Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All temperature claims are based on widely used model ensembles (CMIP6/HighResMIP, nextGEMS), consistent with peer-reviewed literature and expert-reviewed Wikipedia entries.\n- Direct precipitation/snow cover projections were not available, but temperature-based indicators for ski suitability are robust.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile confidence in temperature projections is high due to model consensus and observed trends, year-to-year variability in climate, snow accumulation, and weather events means any single season’s outcome may vary. Factors such as changes in precipitation patterns, the effect of local microclimates, and snowmaking efficiency under warmer and drier conditions increase operational uncertainty. Precipitation type and snow depth were not explicitly modelled in the provided data, so while the overarching trend toward shorter, less reliable cold seasons is highly robust, fine-scale impacts on resort-by-resort operations remain somewhat uncertain.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Focus investments and marketing on the core reliable ski season in January and February, and prioritize adaptation such as snowmaking at the highest, most north-facing altitudes.  \n2. Proactively diversify toward year-round and non-snow-based tourism activities to reduce financial risk from climate-driven reductions in ski season duration.\n\n---",
