  "QuestionText": "How could evolving wind patterns affect financial risk planning in Oujda, Morocco during 2020-2050?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving wind patterns affect financial risk planning in Oujda, Morocco during 2020-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected wind patterns in Oujda to 2050 show no significant changes in minimum or mean wind speeds, indicating minimal impact on financial risk planning related to wind variability.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate model projections for Oujda from 2020 to 2050 indicate steady mean and minimum wind speeds, with no discernible increasing or decreasing trend and only minor seasonal fluctuations. This stability suggests that financial risk planning for wind-sensitive sectors—such as renewable energy, insurance, and construction—should encounter little additional uncertainty from evolving wind patterns. No substantial increase is expected in events like prolonged calms, ventilation losses, or operational downtime due to low winds. Risk assumptions based on historical statistics remain appropriate, but continued monitoring for extreme wind events is advisable. The principal financial risks for the region should focus on hazards other than wind, given this projected climatic consistency.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | No significant projected trend in minimum or mean wind speeds through 2050 | Mean wind (monthly minima) range 3.7–4.0 m/s, trend ≈0.0 m/s/decade, max wind (monthly minima) 7.2–8.1 m/s, stable | CMIP6 HighResMIP, SSP5-8.5, 34.68N, -1.91E | Numeric |\n| 2 | Seasonal cycles of wind speed show consistent differences (i.e., summer windier than winter) but no intensification or change | Seasonal means: summer minima ~4.0–4.3 m/s, winter ~3.5–3.9 m/s, no change over time | CMIP6 HighResMIP | Numeric |\n| 3 | Monthly and annual variability remain low, supporting stable risk models | Interannual std dev ~0.1–0.3 m/s; risk models justified to use past variability | CMIP6 HighResMIP summary | Numeric/Text |\n| 4 | No Wikipedia, RAG, or institutional reports identify increased wind-related financial risks for Oujda | No specific Oujda wind risk entries located | Wikipedia, RAG | Text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: SSP5-8.5 (relatively high emissions), based on multi-model high-resolution projections  \n- Data limitations: Projections are for near-surface winds and monthly means/minima; not all extreme events or local Oujda-specific topographical effects may be captured  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in stability of wind minima; moderate for high-wind extremes or rare compound scenarios\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Continue to use historical wind patterns and variability in financial risk models for wind-dependent sectors in Oujda, updating assumptions only if emerging observed trends diverge.  \n2. Periodically reassess with up-to-date data, focusing especially on rare wind extremes or local infrastructure stressors that might fall outside mean projections.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Wind U” and “Wind V” refer to horizontal wind components (east-west and north-south).\n- “Minima” are lowest monthly or seasonal values; “trend” here means the rate of change per decade.  \n",
