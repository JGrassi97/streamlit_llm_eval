  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of rising average temperatures and subsequent increased air conditioning load on the efficiency of solar farms in the Atacama Desert, Chile, by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2035, solar farms in the Atacama Desert are projected to experience an efficiency loss of about 1.2% due to higher average temperatures, with increased air conditioning demand reducing net solar power available for export.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nContinued warming in Sierra Gorda, Atacama Desert, will raise mean monthly temperatures by up to 1.1°C compared to 2020-2029 values by 2035. As a result, solar panel efficiency will decline by roughly 1.2% annually, primarily from module temperature derating above the 25°C standard test condition. Simultaneously, local air conditioning loads—indicated by a 13% increase in Cooling Degree Days—will increasingly align with midday solar output, diverting a greater portion of generated power for local use rather than export. Despite these factors, the region’s consistently high solar irradiance maintains overall strong generation potential, though grid management and heat-proofing will become progressively important for cost-effective operation.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Projected mean monthly temperature increase of 0.50–1.12°C by 2035 vs. 2020–2029 | Model simulation deltas for 2030–2039 vs. 2020–2029 for Sierra Gorda | nextGEMS pre-final simulation | numeric |\n| 2 | PV efficiency loss of ~0.45% per °C above 25°C leads to an estimated 1.2% drop by 2035 | Standard derating coefficient × local ΔT (0.5–1.1°C), as widely cited | Wikipedia: Solar panel; simulation data | numeric/citation |\n| 3 | Cooling Degree Days (CDD) above 25°C rise by about 13%, boosting local AC demand | CDD rises from 881 to 994 over the relevant period | XCLIM_AI / CMIP6 HighResMIP | numeric |\n| 4 | The deficit in grid export will grow as more solar output serves air conditioning | AC demand peak coincides with PV output increases | XCLIM_AI / CMIP6 HighResMIP | text/numeric |\n| 5 | Extreme heat events (Tmax >30°C) remain rare—limiting direct acute hardware stress | 0 days above critical module temperature thresholds projected through 2050 | XCLIM_AI / CMIP6 HighResMIP | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis uses ensemble average for 2030–2039 under high-emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5); actual emissions pathway may differ.\n- Data limitations: Does not account for local microclimates, module-internal vs. ambient temperature, soiling, aging, or operational practices.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction (efficiency loss and higher AC demand); moderate confidence in exact magnitude of output impacts.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Select PV modules and inverters with low temperature sensitivity or built-in thermal management for all new solar farm projects and retrofits.\n2. Integrate local or on-site battery storage and flexible load management to buffer increased AC consumption and maintain export reliability.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Derating” here refers to the efficiency reduction of PV panels as module temperature climbs above industry-standard test conditions (25°C).\n- “Cooling Degree Days” (CDD) is a measure of how much annual temperatures exceed 25°C, highlighting the need for more cooling (air conditioning) as this index increases.",
