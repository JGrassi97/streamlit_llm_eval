  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will an increase in the frequency of intense rainfall events affect flood insurance premiums for residential properties in Houston, Texas, by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFlood insurance premiums for residential properties in Houston are likely to rise by 2035, driven by increases in rainfall intensity and variability—even if the overall frequency of intense events remains steady or declines slightly.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, residential flood insurance premiums in Houston are expected to increase as insurance risk models shift to account for higher rainfall intensity and greater year-to-year precipitation variability, especially in spring and fall months like May and September. While the total number of extreme rainfall events may not increase—and may even decline slightly—individual events are projected to become more intense, amplifying potential damages and elevating costs for insurers. This growing risk of high-severity flood events, combined with increasing losses per event, necessitates higher premiums. Homeowners and insurers must prepare for more variable and potentially severe flooding, demanding regular coverage assessments and updates to catastrophe modeling.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rainfall intensity and event-to-event variability are increasing in key Houston months | Projected May mean: 113.4 mm (SD 57.9, 2040s) up from 101.9 mm (SD 36.7, historic); higher per-event precipitation | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble | numeric |\n| 2 | Frequency of very intense rainfall spells is stable or slightly down | Wet spells ≥20mm/2 days drop from ~13.3/yr (historic) to ~12.6/yr (2021–2035) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble | numeric |\n| 3 | Insurance premiums increase due to greater single-event severity and higher damage variability, not just event frequency | Synthesis of climate projection and insurance risk practices | \"AI technical synthesis\" | text |\n| 4 | Wikipedia confirms flood insurance is subject to national frameworks and local risk, but has no Houston premium-specific data | No Houston-specific premium figures available | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_in_the_United_States | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assessment based on high-end emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5); assumes current insurance regulation/commercial practices persist without major adaptation.\n- Data limitations: Absence of direct Houston premium pricing or claims history; model-based intensity projections substitute for direct actuarial data.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in increased precipitation variability and single-event severity; moderate confidence in direct premium translation (market and policy factors can modulate outcome).\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Insurers should regularly update flood risk and premium calculations using the latest climate and extreme event data for Houston, focusing on both frequency and intensity projections.\n2. Homeowners should review their insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage for increasingly intense, high-damage flood events, particularly in vulnerable spring and fall periods.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Variability\" refers to how much rainfall amounts can change from year to year.\n- \"Tail risk\" means the chance of rare but highly destructive flood events that significantly impact insurer payouts and premiums.",
