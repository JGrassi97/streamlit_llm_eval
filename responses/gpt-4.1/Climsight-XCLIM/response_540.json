  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the anticipated public health consequences of climate change in the Bay of Bengal region over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change will increase risks of heat-related illness, vector- and water-borne diseases, malnutrition, and mental health burdens due to earlier, more intense heatwaves, rising extreme rainfall and floods, and more frequent cyclones in the Bay of Bengal region by 2050.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next three decades, the Bay of Bengal region (including Kolkata) will face significant public health challenges driven by climate change. Projected trends include earlier and longer heatwaves (extreme heat episodes start nearly 9 days earlier by 2050), increased extreme rainfall and flooding, and persistent cyclone threats. These shifts will heighten risks of heatstroke, dehydration, infectious diseases (malaria, dengue, cholera), food insecurity, and mental health impacts—particularly during May–July (heat) and July–October (flood/disease). Vulnerable groups—urban poor, outdoor workers, children, and the elderly—will be disproportionately affected unless adaptation measures are implemented.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heatwaves will increase and occur earlier, boosting heat-related illness risk | First sustained >35°C events shift from day 149 (historically) to day 139.9 by 2050; peak June–July means rise to 36.16°C | CMIP6 HighResMIP, XCLIM_AI | Numeric |\n| 2 | Extreme rainfall variability and maxima (up to 2,145 mm) will fuel floods and water-borne diseases | Projected annual precipitation maxima exceed 2,100 mm (2021–2035), with high interannual variability | CMIP6 HighResMIP, XCLIM_AI | Numeric |\n| 3 | Past cycles of heavy rain and storms led to infectious disease outbreaks and infrastructure loss | 1942 cyclone/flooding destroyed 7,400 villages, 527,000 houses, with subsequent malaria/cholera outbreaks | Wikipedia: Bengal famine of 1943 | Citation |\n| 4 | Vulnerable populations bear the greatest public health burden due to floods and heat | Density, poor drainage, and crop/labor disruptions increase exposure for the rural poor and urban slum dwellers | XCLIM_AI, Wikipedia | Text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble, SSP5-8.5 scenario; wind/cyclone projections inferred but not modeled in detail.  \n- Data limitations: Local cyclone/wind projections not explicitly quantified; variations between models add uncertainty to extremes.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in increased heat hazard and flood risk; medium confidence in public health outcome magnitude.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Strengthen and climate-proof health surveillance, heat action plans, and water/sanitation infrastructure, focusing on vulnerable populations.  \n2. Improve early warning systems for heatwaves, floods, and cyclones, and invest in sustainable urban drainage and vector control programs.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Heatwaves” refers to periods with daily mean temperature exceeding 35°C for 3+ days.  \n- “Vector-borne diseases” are illnesses like malaria or dengue spread by mosquitoes, whose breeding increases with floods.",
