  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might an increase in calm, low-wind days affect the reliability of wind power generation in the state of Iowa, USA, over the next decade?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nAn increase in calm, low-wind days is not projected for Iowa through the next decade, so wind power reliability should remain very high.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjections for Iowa indicate that calm days—when wind speeds are too low for wind turbines (below 3 m/s)—will continue to be very rare, averaging less than one day per month through 2050, with no statistically significant rise. Wind resource reliability is therefore expected to remain strong, maintaining Iowa’s leading capacity factors of 33–40%. Main risks to reliability are not due to increased calm days but possible short overlap periods of high summer power demand and rare wind lulls. As such, existing wind power installations should remain reliable, though ongoing investment in grid flexibility and forecasting is recommended to ensure continued robust performance in the face of climatic variability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Calm days (<3 m/s) remain very rare through 2050 | Projected mean <1 calm day/mo, no significant upward trend | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model, XCLIM_AI output | numeric |\n| 2 | Wind power reliability projected to stay high | Capacity factors of 33–40%, negligible calm days | Wikipedia: Wind power in Iowa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Iowa) | citation |\n| 3 | Wind speeds in Iowa remain suitable for power generation year-round | Monthly average wind speeds mostly above 1 m/s, highest Nov–Apr, lowest (but generally adequate) July–Oct | NextGEMS model climatology 2020–2050 | numeric |\n| 4 | Warming increases peak summer demand, not calm-wind frequency | More tropical nights projected, but no increase in calm days | XCLIM_AI output | numeric |\n| 5 | No significant change in monthly wind speed trends through 2040s | Year-on-year wind speed differences generally ±0.2–0.5 m/s, with no systematic decrease in summer or winter | NextGEMS model difference analysis | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on CMIP6 HighResMIP models, with regional climate projections and ensemble means; assumes model skill at capturing regional wind variability.\n- Data limitations: Model resolution may not catch very short-lived local calms; outlier low-wind events at the local level cannot be fully excluded.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence for statewide trends; moderate for rare, highly localized calm events or overlaps with heatwaves.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Maintain and enhance high-resolution wind forecasting and grid management to anticipate rare overlaps of low wind and high demand.\n2. Continue diversifying renewable generation and grid interconnections to cushion localized or short-duration wind resource dips.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Calm days\" are days when average wind speed is less than 3 meters per second, below the threshold needed for modern wind turbines to operate.\n- \"Capacity factor\" is the proportion of actual power generated compared to a wind farm’s theoretical maximum output.",
