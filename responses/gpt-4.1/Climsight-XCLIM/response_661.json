  "QuestionText": "What influence will projected temperature changes have on solar panel efficiency in the Sahara region, Algeria by 2050?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat influence will projected temperature changes have on solar panel efficiency in the Sahara region, Algeria by 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2050, rising temperatures in the Sahara near Tamanghasset are projected to reduce solar panel efficiency by about 0.33% annually, with peak summer losses up to 0.54%.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected climate data show that mean annual temperatures in Tamanghasset, Algeria, will increase by approximately 0.74°C by 2050. Based on the well-established temperature coefficient for conventional silicon solar panels (about -0.45% per 1°C rise), this translates to an annual average efficiency reduction of 0.33%, with peak efficiency losses in summer months (June–August) reaching up to 0.54%. Despite these modest losses, the extremely high solar irradiance of the Sahara remains overwhelmingly favorable for solar power. System planners should however account for this temperature-induced derating, especially during hotter months, by considering improved passive cooling, optimal module selection, and accurate yield projections for future-proof investment.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                                        | Evidence supporting the statement                            | Source                                       | Type    | \n|---|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------|\n| 1 | Mean annual temperature in Tamanghasset will increase by ~0.74°C by 2050  | Climate model simulation (Δ annual mean, 2040–2049 vs. 2020–2029) | nextGEMS/CMIP6 high-res projection           | numeric |\n| 2 | Solar panel efficiency drops by ~0.45% per 1°C temperature increase      | Empirical industry standard for silicon panels                        | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar-cell_efficiency | citation |\n| 3 | Annual efficiency loss projected at 0.33%; summer peak up to 0.54%      | Calculation: 0.74°C × 0.45%; June–August ΔT up to 1.21°C             | Calculation using provided monthly values    | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on CMIP6 high-emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5); actual trajectory may differ if mitigation is successful  \n- Data limitations: No account for possible changes in dust, long-term soiling, or changes in solar irradiance or panel cleaning practices  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in the direct temperature-efficiency relationship; moderate confidence in month-to-month extremes and system-level impacts\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Factor an average yield derating of 0.33% in 2050 solar system planning, adjusting for up to 0.54% lower efficiency during the hottest months.  \n2. Prioritize procurement of PV modules with low temperature coefficients and consider design features (e.g. increased airflow, reflective underlay, or passive cooling) to mitigate the impact of high ambient temperatures.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- The “temperature coefficient” describes how much a solar panel’s output drops for every 1°C temperature increase, typically found in manufacturer datasheets.\n- “SSP5-8.5” is a scenario assuming high global greenhouse gas emissions and limited climate policy action.\n\n",
