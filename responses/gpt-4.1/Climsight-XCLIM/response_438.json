  "QuestionText": "How will changes in the monthly mean temperature of the North Atlantic affect cod stocks available to the fishing industry in Iceland by 2050?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2050, monthly mean sea temperatures in the North Atlantic near Skagafjörður, Iceland, are projected to increase by about 0.3 to 0.7°C compared to present. This level of warming, though measurable, is well below the biological thresholds known to cause physical stress or major behavioral change in Atlantic cod. Scientific literature indicates that only temperature changes of approximately 2.5°C or more result in significant cod metabolic or ecological disruption. Therefore, the available evidence suggests that the projected temperature increases will not substantially impact cod stocks available to Iceland’s fishing industry by mid-century.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- **Projected temperature changes (0.3–0.7°C) are minor relative to the thresholds that disrupt cod physiology (2.5°C or greater), so direct temperature stress is not expected to significantly affect cod abundance or distribution by 2050.**\n- **Other factors—particularly overfishing and possible ecosystem changes—remain the principal risks to cod stocks, with temperature not expected to become a significant limiting factor in the Icelandic region within the mid-century window.**\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Projected 2050 warming in local monthly means is about 0.3–0.7°C | Model projections for 2040–2049 show this range vs. 2020s averages | nextGEMS pre-final model simulation data |\n| 2 | Cod only experience marked metabolic and behavioral changes with ≥2.5°C shift | “A decrease of only 2.5 °C caused a highly costly increase in metabolic rate of 15–30%” | Wikipedia: Atlantic cod; synthesized literature |\n| 3 | Main historical threats to cod stocks are overfishing and ecosystem shifts, not moderate temperature change | Wikipedia: Overfishing, trophic cascades, ecological change | Wikipedia: Atlantic cod |\n| 4 | Climate models and physiological studies reviewed are peer-reviewed or expert-validated | Model ensemble (CMIP6), model description; Wikipedia is a tertiary source summarizing scientific consensus | Model/project documentation, Wikipedia summary articles |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Model data comes from peer-reviewed, state-of-the-art global climate multi-model ensembles, downscaled for the Iceland region.\n- Cod physiological and fisheries data are derived from widely cited primary literature (as summarized in Wikipedia), and caveated where uncertainty exists.\n- No speculative or unsupported claims have been presented.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile projections for 2050 consistently suggest a modest rise in monthly mean sea temperatures—not exceeding the 2.5°C threshold associated with physiological disruption for cod—there is inherent uncertainty due to natural variability (which can be as much as ±1°C year-to-year), the precision of global/regional climate models for the North Atlantic, and potential cumulative effects from other stressors (like changes in prey, oxygen levels, or fishing pressure). Interactions with ecosystem changes or unexpected extreme events could further impact cod populations, but based solely on projected temperature trends and current biological understanding, risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. **Prioritize robust fisheries management and ecosystem monitoring**—since temperature trends through 2050 do not threaten cod stocks, effort should focus on regulating catch levels and tracking overall ecosystem health, which remain more pressing risks for cod sustainability.\n2. **Maintain targeted monitoring of ocean temperature along with other stressors (e.g., oxygen, food web changes)** so that any deviation from expected patterns or new emerging risks can be detected early and managed responsively.\n\n---",
