  "QuestionText": "What is the anticipated impact of wind speed changes on the insurance sector in Casablanca, Morocco by mid-century?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy mid-century, wind speed in Casablanca is expected to decrease slightly or remain stable, with monthly average wind speeds for 2040–2049 generally lower (most months show reductions up to –0.86 m/s compared to 2020–2029). Model projections indicate both the frequency and intensity of extreme wind events—such as “windy days” and annual maximum wind speeds—will marginally decline, by about 7% compared to historical averages. For the insurance sector, these projections suggest a mildly reduced or stable wind-related risk for property, infrastructure, and business interruption policies.  \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- This analysis provides **direct insight into future wind risk exposures** that insurers use to price products, set reserves, and anticipate claims in Casablanca.\n- The modest expected decrease in wind hazard reduces the likelihood of upward adjustments in wind-related insurance premiums and suggests no need for new wind-specific mitigation strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Monthly mean wind speeds in Casablanca show a small decrease or remain similar by 2040–2049 compared to 2020–2029 | Climate model simulations for 2020s, 2030s, 2040s | nextGEMS pre-final simulations |\n| 2 | Windy days (≥10.8 m/s) drop approximately 7% from historical (9.09/year) to mid-century (8.45/year, 2036–2050) | Multi-model high-resolution projections | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble (peer-reviewed) |\n| 3 | Annual maximum wind speeds decrease about 7% from historical 40.94 m/s to 38.01 m/s by mid-century | CMIP6 HighResMIP, scenario SSP5-8.5 | Peer-reviewed climate models |\n| 4 | No increase in storm or extreme wind frequency is projected for Casablanca | Composite analysis of XCLIM_AI and model outputs | Model-based (ensemble products) |\n| 5 | No additional wind speed insurance data for Casablanca from general or sector-specific knowledge bases | Wikipedia, ECOCROP | N/A |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Projections use peer-reviewed, ensemble climate models widely used in the scientific community (CMIP6, nextGEMS).\n- Model outputs and summary statements are based on robust, internationally recognized datasets and indicator analysis tools.\n- No unsupported or speculative claims have been included; all data are model-derived or observationally constrained.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe available climate projections are consistent across multiple models and show high agreement for Casablanca, supporting moderate to high confidence in the general trend toward slightly reduced wind risk. However, individual extreme wind events are inherently variable and may still occur, posing occasional localized insurance losses. It is also important to note that the projected changes are small compared to annual variability, so while annual average risk may drop, the insurance sector should remain prepared for outlier years. Urban development and changes in local vulnerability are not captured by wind speed projections alone and could influence realized insurance losses.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Insurers operating in Casablanca should plan for **stable or slightly reduced wind hazard exposure** when setting rates and capital reserves through mid-century, maintaining but not intensifying wind-risk allowances in product pricing.\n2. Continue to enhance risk models by integrating the latest climate projections and monitoring for new urban infrastructure or changes in vulnerability that could offset the mild downward wind hazard trend.\n\n---",
