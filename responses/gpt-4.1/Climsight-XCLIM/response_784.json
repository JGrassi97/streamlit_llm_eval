  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the anticipated impact of wind speed changes on the insurance sector in Casablanca, Morocco by mid-century?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected minor changes in mean wind speeds are unlikely to substantially alter insurance risk in Casablanca by mid-century, though vigilance for extreme wind events remains prudent.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy mid-century (2040–2049), model outputs suggest that Casablanca’s average monthly wind speeds will experience only small fluctuations, generally varying by less than ±1 m/s from the baseline (2020–2029). Typical monthly values remain below 1.5 m/s, without evidence for dramatic increases. Since insurance policies—especially parametric products—rely primarily on extreme wind events for claims triggers rather than on mean wind levels, the overall risk profile for insurers is expected to remain stable, unless there is an unmodeled rise in the intensity or frequency of rare, damaging windstorms. The data does not indicate such a trend, but the insurance sector should remain attentive to any future emergence of extreme wind event risk.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Mean monthly wind speeds in Casablanca change only modestly (<±1.5 m/s) through 2049 | All modeled monthly mean wind speeds for 2020–2049: between 0.27 and 1.55 m/s; most year-on-year deltas small | Provided atmospheric model simulations | numeric |\n| 2 | Insurance payouts for wind are triggered by extreme, not mean, wind speeds | Parametric insurance (e.g., Quintana Roo coral policy) pays by wind speed thresholds for extreme events | Wikipedia, Parametric insurance; summary above | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assessment based on mean wind data; potential changes in frequency/magnitude of extreme gusts or rare windstorms are not directly covered.  \n- Data limitations: No direct projections for maximum gusts or high-wind, rare events; only “mean” monthly wind speeds are analyzed.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in negligible impact on mean wind-related insurance risk; lower confidence regarding rare, destructive wind events.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Insurers and regulators in Casablanca should supplement mean wind speed tracking with monitoring of high-frequency, extreme wind events to guard against unexpected risk.  \n2. Adapt or update parametric and traditional insurance policies if future data shows meaningful changes in windstorm patterns or intensities, even if monthly averages stay stable.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Mean wind speed: The “average” wind speed over a month, not accounting for rare, extreme gusts that can cause damage.  \n- Parametric insurance: A type of coverage where payment is determined by pre-set triggers (e.g., wind over a threshold), not by the actual measured loss.",
