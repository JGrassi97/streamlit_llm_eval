  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow do projected climate shifts alter the risk profile for investors in the global coffee market over the next 20 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected warming and intensified dry seasons in coffee regions like Pereira, Colombia will increase climate-driven volatility, production risks, and adaptation pressures for investors in the global coffee market.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next two decades, climate data for Pereira—representative of Colombia’s coffee heartland—shows mean temperatures steadily rising above Coffea arabica’s optimum, especially during crucial growing seasons. Edge-of-suitability dry-season rainfall (Jan–Mar) will remain below optimal thresholds for arabica, exaggerating water stress, yield variability, and risk of quality decline. Investors face elevated risks from heightened pest and disease vulnerability, more frequent production shortfalls, and asset devaluation in marginal areas. However, opportunities exist in higher-altitude, better-irrigated, or climate-adapted plantations. The dynamic risk profile underscores the need for diversified, resilient supply strategies and targeted adaptation investments to maintain profitability as climate-driven volatility increases.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Well-above-optimum temperatures, especially by 2040s | Jan–May temps rise to 29–30.6 °C, exceeding arabica’s optimal 14–28 °C | nextGEMS climate model, ECOCROP | numeric |\n| 2 | Persistent dry-season rainfall is below optimal for arabica | Jan–Mar precipitation drops to 1.76–6.11 mm/month (well below the 117 mm/month optimal) | nextGEMS, ECOCROP | numeric |\n| 3 | Heat and drought risk exacerbate yield volatility | Simulated average temperature increases of 0.6–1.3 °C and dry months get drier over 2020–2049 | nextGEMS Δ values | numeric/text |\n| 4 | No frost/thaw risk; only liquid precipitation | Temperatures always >23.9 °C and rainfall is always liquid | nextGEMS model | numeric |\n| 5 | Cambisol soils require good management to maintain fertility for coffee | Soil type Cambisol present; optimal soil management is necessary | site/soil data, ECOCROP | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on nextGEMS model ensemble (assumes high emissions and no dramatic adaptation).\n- Data limitations: Pests/disease evolution, irrigation development, and local adaptation measures not fully modeled or projected.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in continued warming and seasonal drought trend; moderate confidence in the rate and spatial uniformity of yield impacts.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in high-altitude, irrigated, or climate-resilient coffee production systems and cultivars; avoid expansion in marginal lowland or rain-fed sites.\n2. Hedge investment risk using insurance, diversify sourcing, and track local adaptation (e.g., water management, varietal innovation) year by year.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Dry season”: Refers to months with lowest rainfall (January–March in Pereira).\n- “Cambisol”: A common tropical soil; fertility and depth suitable for coffee if well-managed, but vulnerable to degradation.\n",
