  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might temperature increases influence the maintenance needs of electrical grid networks in Tripoli, Libya throughout 2030-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures in Tripoli between 2030 and 2050 will amplify heat-related stress on electrical grid components, increasing the urgency and frequency of maintenance due to higher risk of overheating, equipment degradation, and energy losses.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040–2050, Tripoli is expected to experience a mean annual temperature rise of around 1.2°C, with summer monthly means reaching 29–31°C and more frequent extremely hot days. This elevated heat accelerates degradation of conductors and transformers, raises line resistance, and increases energy losses by 3–6%, particularly between July and September when temperatures peak. While changes in precipitation and wind remain minor, the dominant challenge comes from heat extremes compounding mechanical and electrical stresses on grid infrastructure. Proactive inspection, real-time thermal monitoring, and targeted replacement of vulnerable components will be critical to sustaining grid reliability and minimizing outages prompted by escalating heat stress.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement                                  | Source                                      | Type              |\n|---|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | Summer temperatures rise to 29–31°C by 2040–2050                               | 29.7°C in August, 31.0°C in September 2040s | nextGEMS 2040s dataset                      | numeric           |\n| 2 | Temperature increases line resistance, accelerating losses (~0.4%/°C)          | Up to ~3–6% higher losses projected         | Wikipedia: Electric power transmission      | citation/numeric  |\n| 3 | More days above 35°C expected, increasing wear on transformers/grid equipment   | July–September means >27–31°C in 2040s      | nextGEMS, CMIP6/XCLIM_AI                    | numeric           |\n| 4 | Precipitation remains low, not exacerbating grid risk in summer                | <2 mm/month in peak summer months           | nextGEMS datasets                           | numeric           |\n| 5 | Thermal aging and mechanical stress will heighten maintenance need              | Engineering standards on grid performance   | Wikipedia/Citation                          | citation/text     |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes no large-scale adaptation in grid infrastructure; based on high-resolution nextGEMS projections for Tripoli.\n- Data limitations: Lack of explicit data on frequency and severity of localized heat waves or grid-specific load/age profiles.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence that temperature rise will increase maintenance needs, moderate on precise quantitative impacts due to equipment specifics.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Increase frequency and scheduling of inspections and preventive maintenance in July–September; employ thermal imaging to identify heat-stressed components.\n2. Install or upgrade real-time temperature and thermal stress monitoring on key transformers, lines, and substations to enable fast response to overheating.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Line resistance” is the opposition in wires to electricity flow; it increases with heat, raising both losses and stress on components.\n- “Thermal losses” means electricity lost as heat—these go up as wires and transformers get hotter, reducing efficiency and reliability.",
