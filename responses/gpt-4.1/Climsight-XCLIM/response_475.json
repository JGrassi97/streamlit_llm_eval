  "QuestionText": "What is the expected impact of changing monsoon wind patterns on the site selection for new onshore wind farms in western India by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2035, the projected changes in monsoon wind patterns in western India—including the Banswara region of Rajasthan (23.3134N, 74.2179E)—are expected to have only a negligible effect on the feasibility and performance of new onshore wind farms. Climate model projections indicate that both mean and extreme wind speeds during the critical monsoon months (June–September) will remain stable or experience minor increases. The number of 'windy days'—when wind speeds could maximize turbine output—may see only a marginal uptick, with no significant changes in prevailing wind direction. Consequently, wind resource reliability for energy production is not likely to be substantially altered by climate-driven monsoon changes through 2035, allowing developers to base site selection on current wind climatology, local topography, and micro-siting factors rather than anticipated climate variability.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The steady wind patterns indicated by regional climate models support confident investment and planning decisions for wind energy projects in western India through 2035.  \n- Site selection should focus primarily on measured local wind characteristics and landscape suitability, with little concern for dramatic climate-driven changes in wind resource before mid-century.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Mean/exceedance wind speeds during the monsoon remain stable through 2035. | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble: Jun/Jul mean wind 16/13.5 m/s, maxima ~28–31 m/s; no significant trend. | XCLIM_AI/CMIP6 models |\n| 2 | Slight increase in 'windy days' (≥10.8 m/s) during monsoon season by 2035. | +0.6 days/month projected, insignificant change for project economics. | XCLIM_AI/CMIP6 models |\n| 3 | No pronounced trend in wind direction or seasonal wind anomalies. | Month-to-month projections: wind direction shifts <2°, wind speed changes <0.2 m/s. | Dataset summary |\n| 4 | Monsoon regime (southwesterly dominance); no structural shift predicted. | Indian monsoon background context. | Wikipedia/Indian monsoon |\n| 5 | Wind power-specific agroecological or land hazard constraints N/A for site. | No hazards or crop conflicts registered for this locale in 2020s–2030s data. | Natural hazards/ECROP RAG search |\n| 6 | Onshore wind site viability is more impacted by micro-siting/local topography than broad monsoon change this period. | Multi-model synthesis and expert analysis. | XCLIM_AI/CMIP6, local data context |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Wind, precipitation, and temperature projections are derived from peer-reviewed climate model ensembles (CMIP6 HighResMIP), widely recognized as state-of-the-art for regional climate characterization.\n- Supporting context from peer-reviewed and reputable summary resources (Wikipedia entries for Indian monsoon) supplement model results.\n- Direct peer-reviewed field studies for wind farm crop in this precise micro-region are not available; site evidence is climate model and contextual synthesis only.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty\nThe overall uncertainty in projections up to 2035 is moderate to low for broad-scale wind patterns, as supported by agreement across several climate models. However, fine-scale variations—due to local geography, possible shifts in land cover, or unforeseen regional climate anomalies—are not represented at high resolution in global models and could affect actual wind farm performance at a micro level. Natural year-to-year variability in monsoon winds persists, but broad trends give little reason to expect sudden resource declines or major operational challenges related to wind shifts. The main unknowns are thus not about the large-scale climate signal, but about possible local terrain and site-specific factors that all wind farm developers must still assess directly.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Proceed with wind resource assessments and preliminary site selection based on current and projected near-future wind data, emphasizing on-site measurement (met mast or lidar) and local micro-siting studies for optimal turbine placement in western India.  \n2. Maintain periodic reviews of updated regional climate model outputs after 2035, especially for future wind farms with operational lifespans stretching into or beyond the 2050s; adapt plans if robust new projections emerge or if monsoon anomalies arise.\n\n---",
