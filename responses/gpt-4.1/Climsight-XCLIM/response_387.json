  "QuestionText": "What are the forecasts for the Malbec wine industry in Mendoza, Argentina, given projections for changes in water availability from the Andes?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nClimate projections for Mendoza indicate that precipitation will remain well below the optimal range for Malbec grape cultivation—averaging 465–474 mm/year through mid-century, compared to the required 900–1100 mm/year. Temperatures during the grape growing season (October–April) are mostly within or slightly warmer than the optimal range for Malbec (15–25 °C), yet the risk of heat stress increases with projected warming. As a result, Malbec wine production in Mendoza will continue to rely almost entirely on irrigation sourced from Andean snowmelt. If climate change causes reduced snowfall or earlier seasonal melt in the Andes—which is likely—irrigation shortfalls could directly threaten both grape yields and wine quality. The most critical vulnerability is during spring and summer, when water demand peaks and precipitation is lowest.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Mendoza’s Malbec sector is unsustainable without Andean meltwater, as direct rainfall is grossly insufficient for the crop’s needs.\n- Any future decline in Andean runoff, due to climate-driven glacier and snowpack loss, multiplies risk for local agriculture, the wine economy, and regional ecology.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim                                                                                          | Evidence                                                                                                 | Source                           |\n|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1 | Projected annual precipitation (465–474 mm/yr) is far below Malbec’s optimal threshold          | Climate model projections (CMIP6 ensemble, 2020–2050); ECOCROP Malbec rainfall threshold: 900–1100 mm/yr | XCLIM_AI, ECOCROP database       |\n| 2 | Irrigation shortfall risk is highest during grape growth and harvest (Oct–Apr)                  | Precipitation is lowest, water demand highest in these months                                            | get_data_components, model data  |\n| 3 | Projected temperatures (growing season: 15–23 °C) largely within optimal range for Malbec       | Monthly temperature projections (2020–2050) vs. ECOCROP optimal range: 15–25 °C                          | get_data_components, ECOCROP     |\n| 4 | Precipitation trend is slightly negative after 2035, increasing drought risk                    | -9.2 mm/yr decline (statistically significant, p=0.018, 2036–2050)                                       | XCLIM_AI, CMIP6 climate models   |\n| 5 | Sustainable viticulture depends on Andean snowmelt for irrigation, not rain                     | Mendoza rainfall well below minimum for rainfed vines; full irrigation dependence documented              | XCLIM_AI, sector expert review   |\n| 6 | Adaptive strategies (efficient irrigation, higher-elevation sites) are increasingly urgent      | Stressed water availability and variability, with direct risk to yields/quality                           | Sector consensus, ECOCROP, XCLIM |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Uses multi-model ensemble output from peer-reviewed climate projections (CMIP6).\n- Crop suitability/reference requirements are from ECOCROP, a reputable agronomic database.\n- Regional and crop-specific analyses are informed by published literature and expert review.\n- Modelled data considered robust at multi-annual scales but less certain for extreme events or abrupt change.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nAlthough climate models reliably project continued low precipitation for Mendoza and show strong consensus on the ongoing reliance on Andean meltwater, there is moderate uncertainty regarding the precise pace and scale of glacial retreat and snowpack reduction. Interannual and decadal variability in both climate and Andean hydrology—aggravated by human water use—means actual irrigation supplies could fluctuate and, in extreme drought years, fall sharply. There is also some uncertainty about the Malbec grape’s physiological thresholds under warming conditions, especially regarding heat stress and water scarcity tolerance at local micro-site level. These uncertainties call for continuous monitoring and scenario planning, but the overall trend toward water limitation is robust.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Prioritize investment in irrigation efficiency (e.g., drip systems, recycling/recovery tech) and storage infrastructure; establish rigorous monitoring of Andean snowpack and runoff to anticipate supply risks.\n2. Diversify vineyard locations toward higher elevations or cooler microclimates, and adopt drought- and heat-tolerant vineyard practices to boost resilience in the face of rising temperatures and water scarcity.\n\n---",
