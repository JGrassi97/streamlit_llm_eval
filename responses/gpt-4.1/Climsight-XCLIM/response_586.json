  "QuestionText": "What are the systemic financial risks that climate change poses to the agricultural lending portfolios of banks in the US Midwest?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the systemic financial risks that climate change poses to the agricultural lending portfolios of banks in the US Midwest?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is driving increased heat stress and volatile precipitation in the Midwest, significantly elevating systemic risks—including yield losses and default rates—for banks’ agricultural loan portfolios.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBanks with Midwest agricultural loan portfolios face mounting systemic risks from accelerating climate change. By the 2040s, days with both minimum and maximum temperatures above key stress thresholds for major crops like corn are projected to nearly double, with precipitation patterns becoming more erratic and uneven. This combination raises the likelihood of multi-year crop failures, devalued collateral, and simultaneous borrower distress—threatening portfolio stability. Precipitation “whiplash” exacerbates both drought and flood risks, increasing cash flow uncertainty for borrowers and correlated default risk for lenders. Conventional credit risk models may understate these exposures, making scenario-based portfolio stress testing and supporting borrower adaptation critical for financial resilience.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Days above crop heat stress thresholds will nearly double by midcentury | Heat stress days (tasmax >30°C, tasmin >22°C) rise from 26/year (1981–2020) to 45/year (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble | numeric |\n| 2 | Precipitation volatility persists, amplifying drought/flood risks | Annual mean precipitation remains (~2.4–2.5 mm/day) but with increasing year-to-year, seasonal swings (\"hydroclimate whiplash\") | CMIP6 HighResMIP, Wikipedia | numeric/text |\n| 3 | Corn (key Midwest crop) increasingly exceeds optimal climate range | Corn’s optimum: 18–33°C, 600–1200mm rainfall. More months exceed temperature, and rainfall falls outside optimal by 2040s | ECOCROP, retrieved climate data | numeric |\n| 4 | Portfolio losses may be correlated across borrowers and loans | Systemic climate extremes can trigger simultaneous defaults and collateral devaluation | Analytical synthesis, RAG_search, Wikipedia | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis based primarily on CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble for mid-century (2040–2050), SSP5-8.5 (high emissions); actual realized risk will depend on emissions trajectory and adaptation.\n- Data limitations: Climate projections reveal only averages and broad trends; local extremes, sudden shocks, and nonlinear risks may be underestimated.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence for direction of trends (increased heat, precipitation volatility) and systemic risk amplification; moderate for precise yield and loan default rates.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Incorporate physical climate stressors (including heat and precipitation extremes) into agricultural loan underwriting, pricing, and scenario-based stress testing.\n2. Work with borrowers to promote adaptive measures (e.g., drought/heat-tolerant crops, water management practices) and diversify portfolios geographically and by crop type.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Hydroclimate whiplash” means rapid switches between very wet and very dry conditions, increasing unpredictability for agriculture and finance.\n- “tasmin” and “tasmax” are shorthand for daily minimum and maximum air temperature, crucial metrics for crop stress.\n\n",
