  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will future climate conditions impact the mix of renewable energy sources in Germany by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nGermany’s renewable energy mix by 2035 will remain dominated by wind and solar, but increasing seasonal variability—especially wetter winters and drier late summers—will challenge hydro and biomass, stressing the grid’s need for flexibility and storage.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, wind and solar will continue as the core of Germany’s renewable energy portfolio, with climate projections showing stable or slightly increased wind potential, especially in winter, and negligible negative impact on solar generation. However, more pronounced seasonal shifts—with wetter winters and drier late summers and autumns—could reduce hydropower reliability and limit biomass feedstock due to water scarcity during growing seasons. This emerging climate-driven variability emphasizes the need for enhanced grid integration and energy storage to buffer renewable output and ensure energy security amid fluctuating seasonal yields.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Wind energy remains robust, with minor shifts expected | By 2035, monthly wind data show small increases, and Germany had 72.7 GW wind installed in 2024 | Wikipedia: Renewable Energy in Germany; NextGEMS simulation data | numeric/text |\n| 2 | Hydro and biomass face increasing late-summer risk | Late summer precipitation decreases (e.g., September drops −6.54 mm/month by 2035 vs. 2020s); higher risk of water scarcity | HighResMIP, NextGEMS, ClimSight | numeric |\n| 3 | Solar output remains reliable, minimal heat risk | Projected temperature rise (1–2°C by 2035), with rare compound hot extremes; solar efficiency loss <1% | NextGEMS, ClimSight | numeric |\n| 4 | System must adapt to increased seasonality and variability | Model simulations indicate greater swings in precipitation and wind patterns by season | NextGEMS differences 2030s vs 2020s | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on CMIP6/HighResMIP and NextGEMS mid-range emissions; some regional variability within Germany possible.  \n- Data limitations: No high-resolution cloud or PV yield projections; hydropower limited to precipitation and flow data, not plant specifics.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in annual/seasonal precipitation and wind trends through 2035; moderate confidence in intraseasonal patterns and their direct effect on plant-level generation.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize national investment in grid storage (batteries, pumped hydro) and flexible dispatch schemes to manage seasonal gaps.  \n2. Adjust wind and hydro project siting, and update biomass feedstock planning, to reflect anticipated late summer drought and rainfall variability.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “u_wind” and “v_wind”: Meteorological measurements describing wind speed and direction, relevant for wind energy assessment.  \n- “Compound hot extremes”: Days with unusually high day and night temperatures, which may slightly impact solar and biomass yields.",
