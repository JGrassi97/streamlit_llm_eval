  "QuestionText": "What is the potential financial impact of increased summer temperatures on the operating costs (e.g., cooling) for data centers located near Dublin, Ireland, over the next 20 years?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nIncreased summer temperatures near Dublin, Ireland, over the next 20 years are likely to elevate the operating costs for local data centers, primarily due to higher cooling demands. While precise cost projections depend on future climate patterns and energy prices, scientific modeling suggests a notable increase in both average and extreme temperatures for the Dublin area, leading to higher electricity consumption for cooling systems and potentially greater strain on existing infrastructure.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- This answer addresses the relationship between predicted climate change impacts (specifically, summer temperature rise) and how this drives up the energy costs associated with running and cooling data centers in Dublin.  \n- Understanding this impact is crucial for stakeholders planning new data center projects or upgrading existing facilities in the Dublin area due to Ireland's prominent role as a European data-hosting hub.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Summer temperatures in Ireland are projected to rise by 1–2.5°C over the next 20 years. | Met Éireann “Ireland’s Climate: Observed and Projected Changes” (2021) | Met Éireann (Irish National Meteorological Service) |\n| 2 | Increased temperatures will raise cooling energy demand for data centers. | European Commission JRC Technical Report: “Best Environmental Management Practice for the ICT Sector” (2019) | European Commission Joint Research Centre |\n| 3 | Data center energy use for cooling is directly correlated with ambient temperature increases. | ASHRAE “Thermal Guidelines for Data Processing Environments” (2021 update) | American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) |\n| 4 | No published estimates exist for exact cost increases for Dublin data centers in the public domain. | N/A | N/A |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Met Éireann’s projections are based on established climate models and are considered highly reliable.  \n- The European Commission and ASHRAE are recognized expert bodies; sources are policy-reviewed and widely referenced in industry planning.  \n- No peer-reviewed or industry data is public on precise financial cost projections for Dublin data centers.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThere is moderate uncertainty in estimating the exact financial impact due to several factors: variability in future climate patterns, evolving energy prices, advances in cooling technology, and changes in regulation or operational practices for data centers. While temperatures are projected to rise, the extent to which this will translate into direct operating/cooling cost increases depends on specific facility design, efficiency upgrades, and broader energy market changes. Moreover, no public data provides a detailed, location-specific financial forecast for Dublin's data center industry, introducing additional uncertainty for stakeholders.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Conduct site-specific energy modeling and cooling cost forecasts for data centers in Dublin, updated regularly as local climate projections and technology costs evolve.  \n2. Invest in advanced energy-efficient cooling systems and consider incorporating renewable energy sources or heat reuse strategies to reduce the financial impact of increased cooling needs.\n\n---",
