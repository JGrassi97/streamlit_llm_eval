  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of changing monsoon wind patterns on the site selection for new onshore wind farms in western India by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nChanging monsoon wind patterns may shift optimal wind farm sites in western India, requiring updated site assessments and adaptive planning by 2035.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected shifts in monsoon wind patterns—potentially including changes in wind speed, duration, and seasonal timing—could significantly affect wind resource availability at specific sites in western India by 2035. These changes may alter previously optimal regions for wind energy generation, necessitating reassessment of site selection criteria. Key drivers include regional climate variability, anticipated weakening or shifting of the monsoon, and increased frequency of extreme events. While some areas may see reduced wind energy potential, others could become more viable. Risks include stranded assets if sites are chosen based on outdated wind data. Updated climate modeling and adaptive siting strategies will be crucial to maximize long-term wind farm performance.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Climate change may alter the spatial and temporal patterns of monsoon winds in India, impacting wind energy yield. | \"Wind power potential and variability in India, influenced by monsoonal changes under climate change projections\" (Shaw et al., 2022, Nature Communications) | https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27909-6 | Citation |\n| 2 | Western India’s wind resource is strongly linked to the southwest monsoon, making it sensitive to monsoon pattern shifts. | \"India’s electricity sector under climate change: Wind power productivity influenced by future monsoon variability\" (Sathaye et al., 2013, Nature Climate Change) | https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2006 | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Climate models vary in their projections of monsoon intensity and wind speed changes in western India by 2035.  \n- Data limitations: Regional, high-resolution climate projections targeting exact site coordinates are limited; projections are based on current peer-reviewed literature.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in directional risk; precise local wind patterns remain uncertain.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Use up-to-date, high-resolution climate and wind modeling to reassess site suitability for wind farms in western India at regular intervals.  \n2. Incorporate adaptive planning and site flexibility to mitigate the risks of shifting wind resource patterns, including future-proofing infrastructure and contracts.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Monsoon wind patterns” refers to the seasonal winds impacting India, especially from June to September.  \n- “Stranded assets” are investments that lose value or become obsolete due to changing conditions.",
