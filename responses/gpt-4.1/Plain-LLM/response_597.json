  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected change in financial losses for the Japanese rice industry due to damage from stronger winds during the typhoon season by 2040 at Latitude 36.2048, Longitude 138.2529?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nN/A\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nCurrently, there is no accessible, specific projection of financial losses for the Japanese rice industry attributable solely to increased damage from stronger typhoon winds by 2040 at the specified location. While climate modeling suggests that typhoon intensity may rise and historic reports indicate significant economic losses from extreme events, direct quantitative forecasts for 2040, isolated to the factors requested, are not available in the accessible datasets or literature at this time. Risks to Japanese rice farming from typhoon damage are likely increasing, but a monetary estimate for the projected change in losses cannot be provided without regionally downscaled and sector-specific impact assessments.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Climate models project stronger typhoons in the region by mid-century | IPCC AR6 notes increases in projected typhoon intensity in NW Pacific | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report | citation |\n| 2 | Specific financial loss projections for Japanese rice from typhoon wind by 2040 are not available | No accessible dataset provides subnational rice-industry financial loss projections due solely to wind strength by 2040 | N/A | text | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: No accessible projections specific to rice, typhoon wind, and 2040 at this location  \n- Confidence statements: Low, due to lack of precise data\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Initiate or consult regionally-resolved risk assessments and climate impact studies to quantify projections for rice sector losses under typhoon scenarios.  \n2. Encourage investment in resilient rice farming practices and infrastructure to mitigate anticipated climate-related risks.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Typhoon intensity\" refers to the strength of winds and total energy in a tropical cyclone.  \n- \"Downscaled\" means adapting global climate projections to specific local areas.\n\n",
