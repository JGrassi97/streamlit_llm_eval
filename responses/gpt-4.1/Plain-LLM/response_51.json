  "QuestionText": "How will a projected decrease in Sierra Nevada snowpack reduce the water allocations from the Central Valley Project for almond growers near Fresno, California, during the summer months by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nA projected decrease in Sierra Nevada snowpack is likely to lead to lower summer water allocations from the Central Valley Project (CVP) for almond growers near Fresno by 2040. Almond growers in this region, which heavily depend on summer irrigation from the CVP, will face increased water scarcity and likely higher costs for alternative water sources.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Direct link: Decreased Sierra Nevada snowpack means less melting snow feeding reservoirs and rivers serving the CVP.\n- Local impact: Almond orchards in the Fresno area are among the largest agricultural water users in California and are highly sensitive to summer water supply reductions.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Sierra Nevada snowpack is projected to decline significantly by 2040 | California Department of Water Resources projects 30-60% reduction in April 1st snowpack by 2050 | California Department of Water Resources, \"Climate Change and Californiaâ€™s Water,\" 2022 |\n| 2 | Reduced snowpack will lower CVP water deliveries in dry years | Bureau of Reclamation modeling projects decreased CVP allocations under median and dry climate scenarios by 2040 | Bureau of Reclamation, \"SECURE Water Act Section 9503(c) - Reclamation Climate Change and Water 2021\" |\n| 3 | Almonds are particularly sensitive to reduced irrigation in summer | University studies indicate almonds require full irrigation during summer for yield and survival | UC Agriculture & Natural Resources, \"Almond Irrigation Management,\" 2021 |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All sources are governmental or university research, reviewed by experts, using model-based climate and water allocation projections.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe projected decrease in water allocations is subject to uncertainty due to variability in climate models, actual greenhouse gas emissions, and state/federal water policy decisions. Projections depend on future precipitation trends and water management responses such as increased groundwater usage, conservation measures, or policy changes. Specific allocation percentages are not yet available for 2040 and may fluctuate year-by-year according to drought severity and competing demands.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Almond growers should plan for more frequent and severe summer water shortages by investing in water-efficient irrigation systems and considering alternative water sources or crop shifts.\n2. Engage proactively with local water agencies and policy-makers to advocate for adaptation strategies, such as groundwater recharge projects or revised water allocation frameworks, to buffer future water supply risks.\n\n---",
