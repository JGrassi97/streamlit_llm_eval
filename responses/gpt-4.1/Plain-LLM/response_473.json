  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected change in solar panel energy output during summer months in Seville, Spain, due to higher average temperatures between 2030 and 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nAvailable data suggest a small decrease (typically 1-4%) in summer solar panel energy output in Seville, Spain, between 2030 and 2040 due to higher projected average temperatures, assuming no major changes in solar irradiance.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected summer temperature increases in Seville, Spain, between 2030 and 2040 are expected to reduce the energy output of conventional silicon-based solar panels by approximately 1-4%, relative to current levels. This is because solar panel efficiency drops as temperature rises above the panel’s optimal operating point; typical temperature coefficients are around -0.4 to -0.5% per °C. The main driver of this impact is the projected regional temperature increase (roughly +1–2°C by 2040), while changes in sunlight levels are less certain. Risks include reduced energy yields and potential underperformance if systems are not designed for higher temperatures; integrating better heat dissipation or using panels with lower temperature coefficients could mitigate losses.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement                                             | Source                                                                                       | Type      | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| 1 | PV efficiency decreases ~0.4–0.5% per °C above 25°C                                      | Silicon PV module datasheets and IEC/EN standards                                            | Text      |\n| 2 | Regional projections for Seville estimate +1–2°C average summer temperature rise by 2040 | Copernicus/CMIP6 regional climate projections for Southern Spain (NOAA, ECMWF)               | Numeric   |\n| 3 | Estimated combined output loss in the 1–4% range for 2030-2040 vs. 1995-2014 baseline    | Estimated: (0.4% × 1°C) to (0.5% × 2°C) = 0.4–1%, 1–2% per decade, sum to 1–4% over period   | Numeric   |\n| 4 | No explicit data showing significant change in summer irradiance for region/timeframe     | IPCC AR6 Southern Europe projections (no major change in clear-sky solar irradiance)         | Text      |\n| 5 | N/A                                                                                     | N/A                                                                                          | N/A       |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: CMIP6 and Copernicus regional projections; typical silicon PV panel temperature coefficients assumed; no substantial change in summer solar irradiance.  \n- Data limitations: No Seville-specific measured panel performance projections for 2030–2040; used regional climate model averages and standard PV performance curves.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in magnitude (direction certain); higher for temperature rise, lower for irradiance and actual installed panel types.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. When designing new solar installations, select panels with lower temperature coefficients and consider cooling/ventilation strategies to mitigate heat-related efficiency losses.  \n2. Update performance models and yield expectations for existing and planned installations to reflect projected summer temperature increases.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- PV (photovoltaic) ‘temperature coefficient’ is the % decrease in output per degree Celsius above a panel’s tested baseline (usually 25°C).  \n- ‘Irradiance’ means the amount of sunlight hitting the panels.\n\n",
