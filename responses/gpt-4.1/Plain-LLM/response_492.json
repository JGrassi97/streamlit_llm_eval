  "QuestionText": "How will rising average temperatures influence the need for green spaces and urban forests for cooling in Madrid, Spain, over the next 20 years?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nRising average temperatures in Madrid are expected to significantly increase the need for green spaces and urban forests as a way to reduce urban heat and improve comfort over the next 20 years. Green infrastructure will play a vital role in providing cooling effects, mitigating urban heat islands, and protecting vulnerable populations from heat-related health risks.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The answer directly addresses Madridâ€™s projected temperature rise and increased heatwaves, making cooling from green spaces and trees more important.\n- This information is crucial for city planners, policymakers, and residents to adapt to climate change and protect public health.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Temperatures in Madrid are projected to increase over the coming decades. | European Environment Agency projects significant warming for Southern European cities, including Madrid. | European Environment Agency: \"Urban adaptation to climate change in Europe\" (2020) |\n| 2 | Urban forests and green spaces can lower surrounding temperatures by up to several degrees Celsius. | Studies show urban greening provides measurable urban cooling. | Nature-based Solutions for Climate in Europe, European Commission (2021) |\n| 3 | Green infrastructure becomes more critical as heatwaves and extreme temperatures become more common. | Health agencies highlight green spaces as key protection against urban heat and health risks. | World Health Organization: \"Urban green spaces and health\" (2016) |\n| 4 | Existing green spaces in Madrid are already used for cooling and public well-being. | Madrid's climate plans emphasize the importance of shade and urban trees. | Madrid City Council: \"Plan A, Climate Change and Air Quality\" (2017) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The sources cited include reports from reputable international agencies (EEA, European Commission, WHO) and local government documents. These are either peer-reviewed, expert-reviewed, or official planning documents, ensuring credible information.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe analysis relies on climate model projections and generalized scientific consensus, but exact local temperature increases and the real-life effectiveness of green infrastructure can vary depending on factors like local tree species, density, maintenance, and urban development patterns. While the general need for more green space is clear, the magnitude of cooling in specific Madrid neighborhoods over the next 20 years may be affected by changes in land use policy, urban expansion, funding, and public engagement. Some microclimate effects are hard to predict with precision at the neighborhood level.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Prioritize the expansion and maintenance of urban forests and green spaces in Madrid's most densely populated and hottest neighborhoods to maximize cooling and public health benefits.  \n2. Integrate urban greening requirements and heat risk maps into future city planning and development regulations to ensure long-term resilience against rising temperatures.\n\n---",
