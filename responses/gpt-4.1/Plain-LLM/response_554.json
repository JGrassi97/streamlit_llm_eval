  "QuestionText": "How might warmer, wetter conditions influence the prevalence of Lyme disease, carried by ticks, in the Northeastern United States by 2030?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2030, warmer and wetter conditions in the Northeastern United States—specifically near latitude 40.7128, longitude -74.006 (New York City area)—are likely to increase the prevalence of Lyme disease. This is because these climatic changes create more favorable environments for ticks (especially blacklegged ticks, which transmit Lyme disease) and their animal hosts, leading to higher tick survival and expanded geographical range.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses how climate conditions will affect Lyme disease risk at this location by 2030.  \n- Important for public health planning, awareness campaigns, and the management of tick habitats in both urban and suburban environments.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim                                             | Evidence                                              | Source                                       |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Warmer, wetter weather increases tick survival    | Studies predict higher tick abundance with increased temperatures and humidity | Ogden et al., Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 2021 |\n| 2 | Lyme disease risk has shifted northward as climate changes | Observed expansion of tick range and Lyme cases in Northeast US | CDC, 2023; Eisen & Eisen, Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases, 2018        |\n| 3 | Projected climate trends for Northeast US indicate warmer/wetter conditions | Climate models show increased temperature and precipitation by 2030 | US National Climate Assessment, 2018        |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Sources include peer-reviewed journal articles, US government climate assessment reports, and CDC surveillance data. These are well-regarded and reliable sources. No speculative or unsupported claims are included.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile there is strong agreement that climate change will support greater tick populations, some uncertainty remains about the exact magnitude and local timing of increased Lyme disease cases. Other factors—such as local wildlife populations, land use changes, and public health interventions—can also affect disease patterns. Not every year will necessarily be higher risk, as weather varies, but overall trends point toward increased prevalence.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Increase public education and tick prevention measures in the Northeastern US, especially in parks and suburban areas.  \n2. Enhance tick and disease surveillance programs to monitor changing patterns and respond rapidly to outbreaks.\n\n---",
