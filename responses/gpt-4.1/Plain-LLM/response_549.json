  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will the health impacts of climate change differ between urban and rural populations in India by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nUrban areas will face greater heat and air pollution impacts, while rural populations will experience more vector-borne diseases and food insecurity due to climate change by 2040.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, India’s urban populations are expected to suffer increased morbidity from heatwaves and air pollution as cities become hotter and more polluted. Rural areas, however, will likely bear a greater burden of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue, and face heightened food and water insecurity from shifting rainfall and reduced crop yields. Key drivers include rapid urbanization, poor infrastructure, and dependency on agriculture. Both groups face health risks, but urban residents will struggle more with environmental exposure (e.g., heat stress, poor air quality), while rural communities are more vulnerable to infectious diseases and nutritional challenges. Targeted adaptation and infrastructure investments are vital to mitigate region-specific risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Urban residents face rising heat- and pollution-related health risks | Studies project increased exposure to heat and air pollution in Indian cities, leading to higher rates of respiratory illness and heat-related deaths | Ghosh, S. et al., \"Urban adaptation to climate change in India,\" Earth’s Future, 2019 (doi:10.1029/2019EF001228) | Citation |\n| 2 | Rural areas will face more vector-borne diseases and food insecurity | Evidence shows rural populations are more affected by changes in rainfall, crop failures, and vectors spreading malaria/dengue | India: Health of the Nation’s States Report, 2017; IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, 2022 | Citation |\n| 3 | Infrastructure and access to healthcare influence outcomes | Limited rural healthcare access exacerbates disease risks, while poor urban planning intensifies pollution and heat effects | Indian Public Health Standards, National Health Mission; “IPCC AR6 WGII: Asia Chapter” | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on projections assuming current urbanization, warming trends, and adaptation levels  \n- Data limitations: Limited high-resolution, district-level future health outcomes data; underreporting of rural disease burden  \n- Confidence statements: Medium to high confidence in regional patterns, but specific local impacts remain uncertain\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Strengthen urban resilience by improving heat action plans, expanding green spaces, and reducing air pollution  \n2. Invest in rural health infrastructure and climate-resilient agriculture to address disease and food security risks  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Morbidity: Refers to illness or disease outcomes  \n- Vector-borne diseases: Illnesses transmitted by organisms like mosquitoes (e.g., malaria, dengue)",
