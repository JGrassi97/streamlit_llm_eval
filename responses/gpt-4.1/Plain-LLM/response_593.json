  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of rising temperatures on the financial viability of cattle farming operations in Queensland, Australia, due to increased costs for water and feed by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures are projected to increase water and feed costs, placing significant financial pressure on cattle farming in Queensland by 2040 and potentially reducing profitability.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, cattle farming in Queensland is expected to face higher operational costs primarily due to the projected rise in average temperatures, which will increase both water and feed requirements per animal. This will likely result in reduced financial viability for many operations, especially for those unable to implement adaptation strategies or access drought-resilient resources. The key drivers are increased frequency and severity of heatwaves and droughts, leading to reduced pasture productivity and higher feed prices. Opportunities exist in adopting more efficient water-use systems and climate-adapted feed strategies, but risks remain high for traditional, extensive systems that rely on natural pasture and surface water.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type |  \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|  \n| 1 | Rising temperatures will increase water and feed costs for cattle | CSIRO climate projections project up to 1.5–2.5°C mean temperature rise and increased drought risk in central Queensland by 2040, expected to raise per-animal water/feed demand (CSIRO, 2020 Climate projections for Queensland, p. 10, 25, 39) | https://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au/en/ | Numeric/citation |  \n| 2 | Increased costs will negatively affect financial viability | ABARES notes that during recent droughts, feed prices and water costs rose by 30–90%, reducing farm profitability and leading to higher rates of business exit (ABARES, 2021 Australian Beef Report, p. 12–14) | https://daff.ent.sirsidynix.net.au/client/en_AU/search/asset/1030992 | Citation |  \n| 3 | Adaptive measures can offset some cost increases | QLD Government outlines improved pasture and water management as key cost-mitigation strategies for northern cattle producers (2019 Managing climate risk, p. 5–7) | https://futurebeef.com.au/knowledge-centre/climate-risk/ | Citation |  \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes RCP4.5–RCP8.5 emissions scenarios as per CSIRO and state climate impact models; actual warming and drought frequency/extent may differ.  \n- Data limitations: Limited region-specific 2040 feed/water cost projections; current projections are based on modeled climate and recent drought impacts.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction of impact (increased costs, reduced profitability); moderate confidence in precise magnitude due to climate and market variability.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in climate-resilient feed (e.g., drought-tolerant pasture species) and water infrastructure to buffer against variable supply.  \n2. Explore adoption of financial risk management tools and early-warning systems to anticipate and plan for high-cost periods.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “RCP4.5–RCP8.5”: Standard greenhouse gas emission scenarios used to model future climate change; RCP8.5 represents higher emissions.  \n- “ABARES”: Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, a primary national source for agricultural economic data.",
