  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat changes to energy infrastructure will be needed in the Nordic countries to adapt to new climate realities over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nNordic countries will need to increase grid flexibility, expand renewable generation, enhance cross-border connections, and climate-proof existing infrastructure.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nTo adapt energy infrastructure for changing climate realities, the Nordic countries must address increased weather volatility and shifts in demand patterns. This will require boosting grid flexibility through digitalization and storage, expanding renewable power such as wind and solar, modernizing transmission networks (including cross-border interconnectors), and investing in climate resilience—especially for hydroelectric assets facing changing snow and rainfall patterns. Opportunities include leveraging abundant renewable resources and regional cooperation; key risks are supply interruptions and infrastructure damage from extreme weather. Strategic modernization and coordination are vital to ensure energy security and support decarbonization amid increasing climate variability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Grid flexibility is increasingly needed due to weather volatility and variable renewables. | Nordic TSOs highlight need for sector coupling, flexibility, and digital solutions. | https://www.nordicenergy.org/publications/nordic-energy-technology-perspectives-2016/ | citation |\n| 2 | Hydropower systems require updates to adapt to altered precipitation and snowmelt patterns. | Nordic Council report notes climate impacts on hydropower regimes. | https://www.norden.org/en/info-norden/climate-change-nordic-region | citation |\n| 3 | Expansion of cross-border transmission is key for balancing supply and demand. | Interconnector projects (e.g., NordLink) improve security of supply and resilience. | https://ec.europa.eu/energy/infrastructure/projects/pcs/entry/ | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Uncertainties in future climate models, electrification rates, and policy pathways  \n- Data limitations: Limited sector-specific, long-term adaptation cost estimations  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence on trends (need for flexibility, renewable integration); medium on precise infrastructure adaptation costs/timing\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in advanced grid management technologies and energy storage to enhance system flexibility and resilience.  \n2. Accelerate cross-border grid projects and adapt hydropower infrastructure for changing precipitation and run-off patterns.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Grid flexibility means the ability to quickly adjust energy production or consumption in response to supply/demand changes.  \n- Interconnectors are power lines that connect electricity grids across different countries or regions.",
