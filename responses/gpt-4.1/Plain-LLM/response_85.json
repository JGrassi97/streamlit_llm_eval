  "QuestionText": "What is the projected impact of climate variability on the outbreaks of locusts in East Africa and the Middle East by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2040, climate variability—including rising temperatures and more erratic rainfall—is projected to increase the frequency and severity of locust outbreaks in East Africa and the Middle East, including regions near 9.0054°N, 38.7578°E (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia). Wetter conditions from unusual cyclones and shifts in rainfall patterns create ideal breeding environments for desert locusts, likely leading to more frequent infestations and greater risks to crops and food security.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Direct link between climate drivers and locust breeding sites near the provided location.  \n- Crucial to understand for regional agriculture, food security, and disaster preparedness by 2040.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table:**  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Climate variability increases conditions favorable for locust breeding. | 2020 East Africa outbreak linked to unseasonal cyclones and rains enabling multiple breeding cycles. | FAO: Special Alert No. 02, 2020 |\n| 2 | Future climate projections indicate increased rainfall variability and temperature in the Horn of Africa. | IPCC AR6 regional synthesis projects more intense rainfall and higher temperatures through 2040. | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, 2022 |\n| 3 | Greater locust risk to crops is likely under projected climate scenarios. | Expert review highlights link between climate trends and locust outbreak risks in East Africa. | Cressman, K. (2022), \"Desert Locust Forecasting,\" Annual Review of Entomology |\n\n**Source quality**:  \nSources include peer-reviewed articles, official intergovernmental reports (e.g., IPCC), and expert analyses from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), ensuring a high level of credibility.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile there is strong consensus that climate variability (especially increased rainfall and temperature) influences locust population dynamics, predicting the exact scale, timing, and location of outbreaks by 2040 remains challenging. Factors such as local land use, pest control efforts, and unpredictable weather events all introduce uncertainty. Furthermore, most projections are based on regional models that may not capture micro-climatic variations at the local level.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Invest in real-time monitoring and early warning systems for locust activity, especially in areas identified as high risk due to future climate projections.  \n2. Enhance regional coordination on locust management and develop climate-resilient agricultural practices to mitigate crop losses during outbreaks.\n\n---",
