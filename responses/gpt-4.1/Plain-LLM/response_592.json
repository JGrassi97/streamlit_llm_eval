  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will an increase in the frequency of intense rainfall events affect flood insurance premiums for residential properties in Houston, Texas, by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nAn increase in the frequency of intense rainfall events is expected to raise flood insurance premiums for residential properties in Houston, Texas, by 2035.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nProjected increases in the frequency and severity of intense rainfall events due to climate change are likely to elevate flood risk in Houston by 2035. Flood insurance premiums, which reflect actuarial assessments of risk, generally rise as the expected frequency and magnitude of claims increase. Without substantial changes to flood mitigation infrastructure or to the methodology by which insurance rates are calculated, most homeowners in high-risk areas can expect significant premium increases, particularly under public programs like the National Flood Insurance Program. This exposes homeowners to higher housing costs and potential affordability challenges, though opportunities for premium reduction exist through community mitigation efforts and resilient construction.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Flood insurance premiums reflect risk assessments based on projected flood hazard, which increase with frequency/severity of rainfall events. | FEMA methodology for risk rating under NFIP explicitly incorporates frequency of flood events to set premiums. | risk-rating-2.0.nfipservices.fema.gov | citation |\n| 2 | Houston is expected to experience more frequent and severe heavy rainfall events due to climate change by 2035, elevating local flood risk. | NOAA climate models project increases in extreme precipitation in Gulf Coast cities including Houston. | climate.gov/news-features | citation |\n| 3 | Increased flood risk historically leads to higher insurance premiums unless mitigated by local/federal intervention. | Recent rate adjustments in the NFIP reflect updated risk projections due to observed and anticipated climate trends. | fema.gov/fact-sheet/fema-risk-rating-2-0 | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Actual premium increases will depend on the realized frequency/intensity of rainfall, future updates to risk models, and any changes to federal or state insurance programs.\n- Data limitations: Specific projected premium figures for 2035 are not publicly available.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence that premiums will rise in aggregate; magnitude of increase is uncertain due to regulatory and mitigation uncertainties.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Homeowners and local governments should invest in flood mitigation measures and resilient infrastructure to reduce insurance costs.\n2. Stay updated on federal and state insurance program changes, and encourage community participation in CRS (Community Rating System) programs for potential premium discounts.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Actuarial assessments\" means mathematical evaluations of risk to set insurance prices.\n- \"NFIP\" is the National Flood Insurance Program, a federal insurance provider for flood risks.",
