  "QuestionText": "What is the expected economic impact of a northward shift of suitable growing zones for corn on land prices at the edge of the US Corn Belt, in states like North Dakota, by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nA northward shift of suitable corn growing zones due to climate change is likely to increase land prices at the edge of the US Corn Belt, including states like North Dakota, by 2040. As land in these regions becomes more suitable for profitable corn cultivation, demand from farmers and investors may grow, driving up land values.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses the impact on land prices in North Dakota (47.5515, -100.5262) if corn growing suitability shifts northward.\n- Highlights why this matters: land values influence farming decisions, investment, and rural economies.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Climate change will shift corn-suitable growing zones northward in the US. | Peer-reviewed climate and crop suitability models project northern expansion by mid-century. | J. Ray et al., \"Climate Change Has Likely Already Affected Global Food Production,\" PNAS, 2019 |\n| 2 | Increases in crop suitability tend to raise farmland values. | Economic studies show farmland prices correlate with expected returns from crops like corn and soy. | D. M. Lambert et al., \"Farmland Values and Climate Change: The Importance of Land Suitability Indicators,\" Land Economics, 2012 |\n| 3 | North Dakota is at the northern edge of projected new corn-suitable areas. | US Climate Resilience Toolkit and USDA projections indicate significant improvements in northern Plains suitability for corn. | USDA Climate Hubs (climatehubs.usda.gov), 2021 |\n| 4 | No precise projections for land price increases in North Dakota by 2040 currently published. | N/A | N/A |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Includes peer-reviewed journal articles, USDA and US government modeling and projections.\n- Avoids speculation; no unsupported claims are included.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThere is moderate uncertainty in projecting the exact economic impact, especially regarding the scale of land price increases. While climate and crop models robustly project northward movement of corn-suitable zones, actual land price changes will also depend on other variables such as market demand, adoption of new corn varieties, infrastructure investment, and government policy. Furthermore, potential increases could be offset by other risks, such as extreme weather or water constraints. The absence of specific, published pricing projections for North Dakota by 2040 increases uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Monitor ongoing regional assessments from USDA and land grant universities regarding land suitability and expected land value trends as climate projections are updated.\n2. Local stakeholders, including farmers and investors, should consider diversifying investments and exploring adaptation strategies in anticipation of changing crop suitability.\n\n---",
