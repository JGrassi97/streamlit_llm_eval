  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat implications do rising temperatures have on risk assessments for the agricultural insurance sector in Fez, Morocco by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures by 2040 are likely to increase agricultural risks in Fez, necessitating more cautious insurance underwriting and likely leading to higher premiums or reduced coverage.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate projections indicate that Fez will experience higher average temperatures, increased frequency of heatwaves, and greater variability in precipitation by 2040. These changes heighten the risk of crop failures, reduced yields, and increased pest/pathogen incidence for local farmers. For the agricultural insurance sector, this means greater exposure to loss events, making accurate risk assessment more challenging. Insurance firms may need to revise actuarial models, increase premiums, or restrict coverage. There are also opportunities for improved risk mitigation through technology, weather-indexed insurance products, and stronger farmer adaptation measures.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Temperatures in Morocco are projected to rise by 1.5–2.5°C by 2040 under moderate scenarios. | \"Projections indicate increases between 1.5°C and 2.5°C by 2040 for Morocco.\" | World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal: Morocco (2021) | Citation |\n| 2 | Increased drought and yield risks for cereals (main Fez crops) are expected under climate change. | \"Drought frequency in Morocco is expected to rise, impacting major crops in Fez region.\" | FAO: Country Profile Morocco (2020) | Citation |\n| 3 | Insurers in Morocco are already revising agricultural insurance offerings due to climate risks. | \"Morocco has expanded index-based insurance to address extreme weather risk.\" | World Bank, Scaling Up Index Insurance for Smallholder Agriculture in Morocco (2019) | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios for temperature rise.  \n- Data limitations: Specific, high-resolution 2040 projections for Fez are limited; national or regional data used.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on available climate and insurance sector analyses.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Incorporate updated, location-specific climate risk data into insurance pricing and underwriting processes.  \n2. Promote adoption of weather-indexed insurance products and support farmers in climate adaptation strategies.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Index-based insurance\" is insurance where payouts are triggered by pre-defined weather variables (e.g., rainfall), not measured farm losses.  \n- \"Actuarial models\" are systems insurers use to calculate risks and set premiums based on statistical data.",
