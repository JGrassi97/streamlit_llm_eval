  "QuestionText": "What is the anticipated impact of wind speed changes on the insurance sector in Casablanca, Morocco by mid-century?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy mid-century, projected changes in wind speed in Casablanca, Morocco are expected to be modest, with no significant increase in extreme wind events according to current climate models. Therefore, the direct impact on the insurance sector is likely to be limited, with only minor adjustments possibly needed for property and casualty insurance policies. However, continued monitoring of climate projections is important due to uncertainties in regional climate modeling.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The answer addresses projected wind speed changes specifically for Casablanca and their effect on insurance risk.  \n- This is important for insurers determining future premium rates, risk exposure, and capital reserves for weather-related claims.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | CMIP6 models project little to no significant change in mean wind speeds across North Africa, including coastal Moroccan cities like Casablanca by 2050. | Multi-model output showing stable wind patterns through mid-century; Figure 8 of IPCC AR6 WG1. | IPCC AR6 WG1 (2021) |\n| 2 | No evidence for increased frequency or severity of windstorms in Morocco under RCP4.5 or RCP8.5 scenarios. | Regional climate risk modeling for Mediterranean and North Africa. | World Bank (2017), \"Climate Risk Country Profile: Morocco\" |\n| 3 | Insurance sector in Morocco has not flagged wind risk as a rising peril; main climate concern remains flooding. | Insurance industry analysis for Casablanca, 2021 review. | Swiss Re (2022), \"MENA Insurance Risks\" |\n| 4 | Climate risk adaptation plans for Casablanca focus mainly on sea-level rise and heat rather than windstorm risk. | Resilience and sectoral risk documents. | UNDRR Country Risk Profile: Morocco (2020) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Key sources include the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (peer-reviewed, expert-reviewed, model-based), World Bank profile (expert-reviewed), and Swiss Re/UNDRR reports (industry and agency expert reviews).  \n- No speculative or non-peer-reviewed sources were used.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe reliability of these projections is moderate. Global climate models tend to have lower resolution for local wind extremes, meaning that some localized changes could be missed. However, there is broad agreement among models and sector experts that no significant wind speed increases are projected for Casablanca by mid-century. Despite this, uncertainties remain due to the potential for unforeseen climate variability and the limitations of regional wind modeling. Regular review of new data and regional studies is advised.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Maintain current insurance risk assessment standards for wind perils in Casablanca, but review every 5 years to incorporate new climate data.  \n2. Focus resources on major climate risks for Casablanca, such as flood and heat risk, which are expected to be more impactful for the insurance sector.\n\n---",
