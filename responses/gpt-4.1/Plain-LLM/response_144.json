  "QuestionText": "How will future climate conditions alter the market risks for globally traded commodities like coffee and cocoa?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nFuture climate conditions are highly likely to increase market risks for globally traded commodities like coffee and cocoa, especially in the Medellín region (Latitude: 6.2518, Longitude: -75.567) of Colombia. Climate projections suggest greater temperature extremes, unpredictable rainfall, and increased pest/disease pressure, all of which may disrupt local yields and global supply chains. This will make prices more volatile and heighten risks for producers, exporters, and international markets.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Addresses how local climate changes in a key coffee and cocoa region affect global commodity risks.  \n- Critical for risk management strategies among producers, traders, and policymakers dealing with these crops.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Rising temperatures will reduce suitable land for coffee and cocoa in Colombia. | IPCC AR6: Coffee suitability in Colombia could decrease significantly with 2°C warming. | IPCC AR6 WGII, 2022 |\n| 2 | Increased pest and disease risks (e.g., coffee leaf rust) under climate change. | Studies in Colombia report higher pest incidences with warmer, wetter conditions. | Ovalle-Rivera et al., Climatic Change, 2015 |\n| 3 | Likelihood of supply shocks leading to global price volatility. | Past extreme weather events in Latin America triggered coffee price surges. | International Coffee Organization, 2020 |\n| 4 | Projected increase in rainfall unpredictability impacting harvests. | Regional projections show variability in precipitation patterns in Antioquia. | IDEAM (Colombian weather authority), 2022 |\n| 5 | Adaptation possible but costly (e.g., shifting crops, irrigation). | Farmers require technical and financial support to adapt practices. | TechnoServe/USAID report, 2021 |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Most sources are peer-reviewed (e.g., IPCC, Climatic Change journal) or official reports (ICO, IDEAM).\n- Evidence is based on climate models, empirical studies, and expert analysis.\n- No speculative or anecdotal claims included.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nFuture climate projections carry notable uncertainty: while general trends (higher temperatures, more extreme weather) are clear, the precise degree of local impact—such as which areas around Medellín will become unsuitable for coffee/cocoa and the timeline of these effects—remains variable. Much of the existing data is based on scenarios from global or regional climate models that may not perfectly capture microclimates or farmer adaptability. Additionally, the speed and scale at which global markets reflect these changes can fluctuate due to policy, logistics, and technological adaptation. Thus, risk levels should be understood as medium-to-high, but not precisely quantifiable.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Local producers and exporters should invest in climate-resilient practices (such as drought-resistant varietals, shade management, or water conservation) to mitigate risk exposure.  \n2. Collaborate with regional authorities and industry groups to monitor climate impacts and support adaptation funding, ensuring ongoing participation in global coffee and cocoa markets.\n\n---",
