  "QuestionText": "How will a projected increase in the number of days with average temperatures over 35°C affect the available working hours for manual farm labor during the summer harvest season in Spain's Murcia region by 2030?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nA projected increase in the number of days with average temperatures exceeding 35°C by 2030 in Murcia, Spain, is likely to significantly reduce the number of safe and productive working hours available for manual farm labor during the summer harvest season. Heat stress risks will limit outdoor work, requiring shorter shifts, adjusted schedules to cooler parts of the day, or more frequent breaks for worker safety and legal compliance.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Direct impact: Higher temperatures make it unsafe to work during peak daylight hours, directly reducing available working hours.\n- Ecosystem/decision context: This limits harvest productivity, may constrain crop yields, and affects worker health, necessitating adaptation by farm managers and policymakers.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Days above 35°C predicted to increase in southern Spain by 2030 | Climate projection models show up to 20 more days >35°C annually in Murcia region by 2030 | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Working Group I (2021), regional projections; Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) |\n| 2 | Occupational health guidelines require adaption of work hours above 35°C | Spanish labor law and WHO recommend limiting heavy outdoor labor during extreme heat | WHO: \"Protecting workers from heat stress\" (2018); Spanish Ministry of Labor |\n| 3 | Heat stress decreases effective work hours and increases health risk | Peer-reviewed studies link >35°C temps with sharp reductions in safe work time for farm laborers | Kjellstrom et al., \"Work hours lost due to heat\" (Global Health Action, 2009) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The sources referenced are a mix of peer-reviewed scientific papers, official climate model projections (IPCC, AEMET), and governmental/WHO occupational health guidelines, providing high credibility.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThere is a moderate degree of uncertainty regarding the exact number of days exceeding 35°C each year and how farms may adapt operation protocols in response. Climate models are robust in projecting increased heat extremes but local variability and microclimates can cause deviations. Additionally, how rigorously labor laws and heat-stress guidelines are enforced, and the extent of technological or schedule adaptation by farms, will influence the actual reduction in working hours. However, the general finding—that significant reduction in safe outdoor work hours is highly likely—is supported by broad consensus in the scientific and public health literature.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Plan harvest schedules to maximize work during cooler early morning/evening hours and increase rest breaks on very hot days; consider shifting more labor to non-peak-heat periods.\n2. Invest in shade structures, hydration stations, and worker heat-safety training to reduce heat stress risks and comply with labor laws.\n\n---",
