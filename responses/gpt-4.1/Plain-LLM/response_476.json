  "QuestionText": "How will reduced average rainfall affect the reservoir levels and power generation capacity of the Akosombo Dam in Ghana by mid-century?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will reduced average rainfall affect the reservoir levels and power generation capacity of the Akosombo Dam in Ghana by mid-century?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nReduced rainfall is projected to lower Akosombo reservoir levels, significantly decreasing its hydropower generation capacity by mid-century.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy mid-century (2050), climate change models project declining average rainfall over the Volta River Basin, which feeds the Akosombo Dam. Reduced rainfall will lower inflows into Lake Volta, resulting in decreased reservoir levels. This decline directly reduces the dam’s ability to generate electricity, especially during prolonged droughts or dry seasons. The risks include unreliable power supply, economic impacts, and increased pressure on alternative energy sources. Despite some natural variability, the trend of reduced precipitation alongside rising temperatures may amplify these effects if adaptive measures are not taken.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Reduced rainfall is projected for the Volta Basin by 2050 | Multi-model projections suggest a decline in mean annual rainfall by up to 22% under dry scenarios | Stanzel et al., 2018, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences | Citation |\n| 2 | Decreased rainfall lowers Akosombo reservoir levels and hydropower production | Observed hydroelectric output fell during past droughts when reservoir inflows declined | Kankam-Yeboah et al., 2013, Water International | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections vary based on emission scenarios (RCP4.5 vs. RCP8.5), but both generally indicate decline in rainfall.  \n- Data limitations: Regional hydrological modeling has uncertainty due to limited long-term observed climate data and local watershed changes.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate-to-high confidence based on multi-study, multi-model consensus for regional precipitation trends.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in reservoir management strategies and water-saving technologies to buffer against drought periods.\n2. Diversify national energy sources, including investment in solar or wind, to reduce dependence on hydropower.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Hydropower: Electricity produced from the movement of water (flowing through a dam).\n- RCP4.5/RCP8.5: Common scenarios for future greenhouse gas concentrations used in climate modeling.",
