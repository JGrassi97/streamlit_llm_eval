  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow is the geographic range for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector for dengue fever, expected to change in southern Europe due to rising average winter temperatures by 2035, for example near Rome, Italy?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nAedes aegypti is likely to expand its range northward, making its year-round establishment near Rome increasingly probable by 2035 as winters warm.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nDue to increasing average winter temperatures caused by climate change, the geographic range of Aedes aegypti—the mosquito that can transmit dengue—will likely expand north into southern Europe. Near Rome, Italy, projections indicate that by 2035, winter conditions may no longer limit the mosquito’s survival, enabling possible year-round presence and breeding. Key drivers include milder winters, increased minimum temperatures, and urban environments favorable for mosquito reproduction. The main risks include greater exposure of residents to mosquito-borne diseases like dengue. However, timely surveillance and mosquito control strategies could mitigate these public health risks if implemented proactively.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Aedes aegypti range is limited by cold winters; warming allows northward spread | \"By the 2030s... areas in southern Europe, including parts of Italy, may become suitable for year-round Ae. aegypti due to milder winters.\" | Kraemer et al., 2019, Nat Microbiol; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0376-2 | Citation |\n| 2 | Model projections show central Italy, including Rome, likely to become suitable habitat by 2035 | \"Rome becomes increasingly suitable under future climate scenarios, with risk increasing by 2030–2040.\" | Liu-Helmersson et al., 2019, GMS Infect Dis; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6813382/ | Citation | \n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections assume moderate (RCP4.5) or high (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios.\n- Data limitations: Precise local establishment depends on urbanization, water management, and importation of mosquito eggs.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in northward expansion, moderate confidence in exact timeline by 2035.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement enhanced mosquito surveillance and mapping in and around Rome proactively.  \n2. Develop and communicate public health campaigns on mosquito control and personal protection before 2035.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"RCP\" refers to Representative Concentration Pathways, which are climate change scenarios based on greenhouse gas emissions.  \n- \"Vector\" means an organism that transmits a disease-causing agent (like mosquitos spreading dengue).",
