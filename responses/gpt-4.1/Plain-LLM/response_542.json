  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the primary climate-related health risks for populations in Southern California, USA, through 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nThe main climate-related health risks in Southern California by 2050 are increased heat-related illnesses, poor air quality, expanded vector-borne diseases, and wildfire-related health impacts.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nThrough 2050, Southern California is projected to face significant health risks from climate change, especially due to more frequent and intense heatwaves, worsening air pollution (including ozone and wildfire smoke), expansion of vector-borne diseases like West Nile virus, and increased wildfire frequency. Vulnerable populations—including older adults, children, outdoor workers, and low-income communities—are at higher risk. Key drivers include rising average temperatures, reduced precipitation, and longer fire seasons, which also amplify pre-existing health disparities. Addressing these risks presents opportunities for health system adaptation, public health interventions, and climate-resilient urban planning.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heatwaves are projected to increase, leading to more heat-related illnesses | By mid-century, annual average number of extreme heat days in Los Angeles could increase 3-5 times | “Climate Change in the Los Angeles Region” (UCLA, 2012) | Numeric |\n| 2 | Air quality (ozone, wildfire smoke) will worsen, aggravating respiratory and cardiovascular diseases | Wildfires in CA increased PM2.5 pollution; observed links to asthma ER visits | “Wildfire Smoke: A Guide for Public Health Officials” (EPA, 2019); CDC | Citation |\n| 3 | Vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus likely to expand with warmer temperatures | West Nile virus cases in CA linked to temperature/rainfall variation | California Department of Public Health, 2022 | Citation |\n| 4 | Wildfires and drought will increase mental health burdens | Post-wildfire trauma and anxiety well-documented | “Mental Health and Wildfires” (CDC, 2022) | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on mid-to-high emissions scenarios (e.g., RCP 4.5-8.5)  \n- Data limitations: Regional projections may vary; health impacts depend on adaptation efforts  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence for heat/air quality impacts; moderate for vector-borne spread and mental health\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in heatwave early warning systems and urban cooling strategies (e.g., cool roofs, shade infrastructure).  \n2. Strengthen surveillance and mitigation for air quality and vector-borne diseases, including public health outreach targeting high-risk groups.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “PM2.5” refers to fine airborne particles that can harm lung and heart health.  \n- “Vector-borne diseases” are illnesses spread by organisms like mosquitoes (e.g., West Nile virus).",
