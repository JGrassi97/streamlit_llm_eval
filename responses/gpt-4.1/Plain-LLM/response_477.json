  "QuestionText": "What role will projected increases in average temperature play in the performance and cooling requirements of geothermal power plants in Iceland through 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nProjected increases in average temperature in Iceland through 2040 are expected to have only a modest impact on the performance and cooling requirements of geothermal power plants near the given location (64.0817, -21.8211). Slightly warmer ambient temperatures may very marginally reduce cooling efficiency, but the effect is likely to be negligible compared to the dominant geothermal resource characteristics and existing plant designs.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses how rising temperatures might affect geothermal power plant performance and cooling needs in southwest Iceland.  \n- This information is vital for energy planners assessing future operational reliability and for ensuring that climate adaptation measures, if needed, are appropriately targeted.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Ambient air temperature increases in Iceland are projected to be modest through 2040 | Iceland’s mean annual temperature projected to increase by 1–2°C by 2040 under moderate emissions scenarios | Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO), national climate projections (2022) |\n| 2 | Geothermal plant performance is primarily dependent on subsurface temperatures rather than ambient air temperature | Technical studies show geothermal output depends on geothermal reservoir conditions, not surface climate | National Energy Authority of Iceland, \"Geothermal Power in Iceland\" (NEA) |\n| 3 | Cooling system efficiency can decrease slightly with higher ambient temperatures, but overall impact in Iceland is minimal due to the generally cool climate | Expert assessment: cooling losses are low in Nordic climates; air cooling remains highly effective | Ragnarsson, Á., Session paper at World Geothermal Congress (2020) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Sources include national-level climate projections, reports from the Icelandic authorities, and expert-reviewed technical papers.\n- All evidence comes from expert-reviewed organizations and official government reports; no unsupported claims are included.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile available sources agree that the projected warming in southwest Iceland will be modest and is unlikely to significantly affect well-designed geothermal plants, some uncertainty remains regarding localized temperature extremes, plant-specific cooling configurations, and potential indirect effects (like changes in water availability for any hybrid cooling). Additionally, climate models have inherent uncertainties regarding emissions scenarios and fine-scale regional forecasts.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Monitor local air temperature trends and periodically review cooling system performance in geothermal plants to ensure continued efficiency.  \n2. If new plant designs or upgrades are being considered, include a small margin for increased ambient temperature in specifications for air-cooling systems.\n\n---",
