  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of rising average temperatures and subsequent increased air conditioning load on the efficiency of solar farms in the Atacama Desert, Chile, by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures will slightly reduce solar panel efficiency, but increased air conditioning demand may boost the value of solar energy despite minor output losses.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, average temperature increases in the Atacama Desert are expected to slightly lower solar panel efficiency due to the well-known negative temperature coefficient of photovoltaic (PV) modules—typically resulting in a 0.4–0.5% output decrease per °C rise. However, growing air conditioning needs will likely increase daytime electricity demand, which coincides with peak solar generation, improving the economic attractiveness of solar farms. The main risk is reduced panel output during hotter periods, though the opportunity lies in capturing a larger market for solar energy as cooling requirements rise. Data limitations exist for site-specific projections, but overall impacts on efficiency are expected to be modest.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Higher temperatures reduce PV efficiency (by ~0.4-0.5% per °C) | “The typical temperature coefficient of power for crystalline silicon PV modules is -0.4 to -0.5%/°C” | IEA PVPS Task 13 Factsheet (2020) | citation |\n| 2 | Atacama expected to warm by ~1–2°C by 2035 | “Projected temperature increases in northern Chile: 1.0–2.0°C by 2035” | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2021) | citation |\n| 3 | Higher AC demand aligns with peak solar generation, raising solar’s grid value | “Peak demand due to air conditioning use occurs during high insolation, aligning with PV output” | IEA – The Future of Cooling (2018) | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on IPCC mid-range climate scenarios (SSP2-4.5 to SSP5-8.5)  \n- Data limitations: Site-specific AC load projections and module technology details are limited  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in qualitative trends; quantitative effects may vary locally\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Use solar panels with better high-temperature performance (lower temperature coefficients) in new installations.  \n2. Explore energy storage or demand management strategies to maximize financial benefit during periods of high cooling demand.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Temperature coefficient: Describes how much a solar panel’s output drops as temperature rises (measured in % loss per degree Celsius).  \n- PV (photovoltaic): Technology that converts sunlight directly into electricity.",
