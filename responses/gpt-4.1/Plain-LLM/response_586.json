  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the systemic financial risks that climate change poses to the agricultural lending portfolios of banks in the US Midwest? (Location: Latitude 41.5868, Longitude -93.6213)\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change increases loan default risk for Midwest agricultural banks due to greater weather volatility, crop yield loss, and asset devaluation.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAgricultural lenders in the US Midwest face systemic financial risks from climate change, primarily driven by higher probabilities of extreme weather events, such as drought and flooding, that impact crop yields and farm income. These changes can increase the likelihood of loan defaults, reduce the collateral value of farmland, and destabilize local agricultural economies. Additional risks include insurance market disruptions and the potential decline in land values due to long-term climate trends. These factors compound to threaten overall portfolio stability and could affect the wider banking sector if risk concentrations are high.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Extreme weather causes yield and income volatility | USDA reports increasing yield variability, frequent extreme weather events in Midwest | USDA Climate Hubs (https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/midwest/topic/climate-impacts-agriculture) | citation |\n| 2 | Increased loan default risk | USDA and Federal Reserve Bank report ag loan delinquencies can rise after crop loss | Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (https://www.kansascityfed.org/agriculture/agfinance-updates/the-impact-of-weather-on-farm-loan-performance/) | citation |\n| 3 | Farmland value at risk from persistent climate impacts | Land values linked to long-term productivity, threatened by ongoing climate risk | USDA (https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2018/june/land-values-2018-summary/) | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Highly dependent on future greenhouse gas emissions and local adaptation measures  \n- Data limitations: No unified public dataset quantifies Midwest-wide loan default rates from climate impacts; available sources analyze partial effects  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate to high confidence in linkage between climate risk and financial exposure based on public reporting\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Integrate climate risk assessments into loan underwriting and stress-testing processes to better estimate potential losses.  \n2. Diversify agricultural lending portfolios and encourage borrower adoption of climate-resilient practices to mitigate exposure.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Loan default” means failure to pay back a loan.  \n- “Collateral value” is the worth of property or assets used to secure a loan.  \n- “Systemic” risk is risk that can spread across the entire financial system, not just individual loans.",
