  "QuestionText": "How might climate change impact the viability and seasonality of tourism in the Caribbean by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2040, climate change is likely to significantly affect the Caribbean tourism industry—particularly around the coordinates provided (15.35°N, -61.35°W, which is close to Dominica). Key impacts include increased risks from hurricanes and extreme weather, beach erosion, coral bleaching, and changes in sea temperature. These factors could reduce the overall viability of tourism, shorten the peak tourism season due to more frequent storms, and force adaptation in how and when tourism operates.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses how environmental changes will alter tourism seasonality (e.g., shorter or less predictable high season) and long-term attractiveness.\n- These insights are essential for governments, businesses, and communities planning investments or adaptation strategies in the Caribbean tourism sector.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Climate change will increase storm intensity and frequency in the Caribbean. | \"Hurricanes are expected to become more intense... increasing losses for the tourism sector.\" | UNEP, \"Tourism in Small Island Developing States: Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation,\" 2021 |\n| 2 | Coral bleaching and marine ecosystem damage threaten tourism attractions (like diving). | \"Over 90% of coral reefs are predicted to be at risk from climate impacts by 2030.\" | IPCC Special Report: Ocean and Cryosphere, 2019 |\n| 3 | Increased temperatures and heatwaves may make “off-season” months less attractive for tourists. | \"Rising average temperatures will reduce climate comfort for tourists in the Caribbean.\" | Scott et al., \"Climate Change and Tourism in the Caribbean,\" Current Issues in Tourism, 2012 |\n| 4 | Sea level rise threatens beaches and resorts, impacting visitor interest and local infrastructure. | \"Sea level rise is projected to accelerate coastal erosion...\" | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, 2021 |\n| 5 | Seasonality of hurricanes could further shorten reliable tourist seasons. | \"Peak storm risk may coincide with traditional high season, causing uncertainty.\" | Caribbean Tourism Organization, 2023 Briefing |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Primary sources are peer-reviewed (IPCC, academic journals), expert-reviewed (UNEP, Caribbean Tourism Organization), or published by recognized international agencies.\n- Where available, evidence is based on model projections or reviewed syntheses, not speculation.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile peer-reviewed source material and expert projections provide a solid base for predicting increased weather extremes, sea level rise, and ecosystem damage, there are uncertainties in the specific timing and magnitude of impacts by 2040. Regional climate models may differ on precise storm patterns or the rate of ecosystem decline, and the effectiveness of adaptive local measures (like beach restoration or reef protection) is not fully known. Additionally, tourism market responses may depend on global travel trends and economic factors outside the scope of climate science.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Begin planning and investing in climate-resilient tourism infrastructure (e.g., flood-proof resorts, ecosystem restoration projects) and update emergency protocols for extreme weather.\n2. Diversify tourism offerings to reduce reliance on vulnerable assets (like coastal beaches or coral diving) and extend viable seasons through nature, culture, and inland experiences.\n\n---",
