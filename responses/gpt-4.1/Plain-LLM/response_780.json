  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might projected climate changes alter insurance risk assessments in Rabat, Morocco over the next three decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected climate changes are likely to increase insurance risks in Rabat due to higher frequency and severity of extreme weather events, especially flooding and heatwaves.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next thirty years, projected climate changes for Rabat include rising average temperatures, more frequent heatwaves, altered rainfall patterns, and increased risk of flooding, particularly due to more intense rainfall events. These trends would likely prompt insurers to reassess risk profiles for property, health, and agriculture insurance by considering higher probabilities of weather-related damages and losses. Risk models may be updated with more conservative loss estimates, driving premiums higher and potentially limiting coverage availability in highest-risk areas. The main drivers are projected climatic extremes and urban vulnerability, with opportunities for risk reduction via adaptation investments.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Risk of flooding in Rabat is projected to increase due to more frequent and extreme rainfall events. | Morocco’s 2023 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) notes increased flood risk in coastal cities including Rabat. | https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Morocco%20First/Morocco%20NDC%20English.pdf | citation |\n| 2 | Temperature projections indicate more frequent and severe heatwaves in Morocco, affecting health and property risk. | World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal for Morocco projects up to 2.5°C warming by 2050, with more extremes. | https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/morocco | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections typically refer to medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5–RCP8.5) as used by referenced sources.  \n- Data limitations: Localized impact studies for Rabat are limited and often based on national or regional projections.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate-to-high confidence in direction of trends, but site-specific risk magnitudes are uncertain.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Update insurance models for Rabat to explicitly account for increased flood and heatwave frequencies; incorporate recent climate projections in risk assessments.  \n2. Encourage policyholders to adopt adaptation measures (e.g., flood defenses, heat-resilient construction) by linking premium reductions to resilience investments.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"NDC\" refers to Nationally Determined Contribution, a climate plan submitted to the UN.  \n- RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are climate change projection scenarios representing intermediate to high greenhouse gas emissions futures.",
