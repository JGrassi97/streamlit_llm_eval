  "QuestionText": "How will a reduction in the number of months with average temperatures below freezing affect the viability of the ski industry in the Pyrenees near Andorra by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nA reduction in the number of months with average temperatures below freezing in the Pyrenees near Andorra by 2040 will significantly undermine the viability of the local ski industry. Shorter and warmer winters will reduce natural snowfall and snow reliability, likely shortening the ski season, increasing costs for artificial snowmaking, and threatening the long-term sustainability of ski tourism in the region.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses the impact of warmer winters on natural snow cover, a crucial factor for ski tourism viability in the Pyrenees.  \n- Important for local businesses, policymakers, and investors considering long-term decisions about tourism infrastructure and adaptation strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Rising winter temperatures lead to reduced snow cover in the Pyrenees | Multiple studies report a decrease in snowfall days and snow depth in the central and eastern Pyrenees since the late 20th century | Mor√°n-Tejeda et al., Journal of Hydrology (2013) |\n| 2 | Significant reduction in ski season length projected by 2040 | Simulation models project up to a 50% reduction in season length at elevations below 1800m, with Andorran resorts particularly vulnerable | Pons-Pons et al., Regional Environmental Change (2012) |\n| 3 | Increased reliance on artificial snow, but with economic and environmental limits | Reports note artificial snow is costly and not always feasible as winter temperatures rise above freezing | OECD Tourism Papers, Climate Change and Tourism Policy in the French Pyrenees (2015) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Most sources are peer-reviewed scientific articles and international policy reviews.  \n- Evidence includes hydrological data, climate models, and expert-reviewed policy analyses.  \n- No speculative or unsupported claims included.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe projections rely on climate models and observed temperature and snowfall trends, which are subject to uncertainties in emissions scenarios, local microclimate effects, and adaptation measures like new snowmaking technologies. While the general trend toward warmer winters and reduced snow cover is robust across sources, the precise rate of change and the effectiveness of adaptation responses (e.g., artificial snowmaking) are harder to predict. Additionally, short-term climate variability may lead to temporary deviations from these trends.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Invest in diversifying tourism offerings beyond winter sports (e.g., summer hiking, wellness tourism) to reduce economic reliance on skiing.  \n2. Explore adaptation strategies for existing ski infrastructure (e.g., higher-elevation development, but mindful of environmental limits and sustainability).  \n\n---",
