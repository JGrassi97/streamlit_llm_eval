  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nWarmer winters in the southern United States, including around 33.749°N, -84.388°W (Atlanta, GA region), are likely to increase the overall pressure from overwintering agricultural pests over the next two decades. Milder winter temperatures generally allow more pests to survive through winter, expand their geographic ranges, and lead to higher pest populations in the subsequent growing seasons.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The answer focuses on increased pest survival and earlier activity in the context of the southern US.  \n- Understanding this shift helps farmers and decision-makers plan integrated pest management strategies for resilient cropping systems.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Warmer winters allow higher survival of overwintering pests. | Several insect pest species overwinter more successfully with less cold. | IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land, 2019 |\n| 2 | Southern US cropping systems (e.g., cotton, soybean) are particularly vulnerable to pest outbreaks with mild winters. | Southern US studies report increased pest abundance following warm winters. | USDA Southern Region IPM Center, 2022 |\n| 3 | Geographic ranges of pests are expanding northwards as winters warm. | Range expansions observed for pests like Helicoverpa zea (corn earworm). | Diffenbaugh et al., 2008 (PNAS) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Sources include peer-reviewed papers, intergovernmental assessments (IPCC), and expert-agency region-specific reports (USDA Southern Region IPM Center). All are credible and publicly cited.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nAlthough the general trend that warmer winters benefit pest survival is well established, the magnitude of change at a specific location (such as 33.749, -84.388) can vary based on yearly weather extremes, pest species’ biology, crop types, and local management practices. Some pests may benefit more than others. Additionally, secondary effects—such as increased natural enemies or changes in rainfall patterns—may partially offset or exacerbate pest pressure, but current projections mainly indicate a net increase in risk.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Implement and regularly update integrated pest management (IPM) plans that incorporate regional pest monitoring and climate forecasts.  \n2. Encourage local research and extension services to identify and promote resilient crop varieties and biological controls suited for changing pest pressures.\n\n---",
