  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will public health systems in sub-Saharan Africa need to adapt to cope with climate-related health threats by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nPublic health systems must strengthen surveillance, infrastructure, and community outreach to address intensified infectious diseases, heat stress, and food insecurity linked to climate change.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, sub-Saharan Africa’s public health systems will need to adapt to climate-related threats such as rising vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria, dengue), heat-related illnesses, and malnutrition from food insecurity. Main drivers include increasing temperatures, extreme weather patterns, and changing disease vectors. Key opportunities involve integrating climate information into health planning, scaling up early-warning surveillance, investing in resilient infrastructure, and empowering community health workers. Risks include overburdened systems, funding gaps, and unequal adaptation between regions. Adaptation will require multisectoral coordination and targeted investment to protect vulnerable populations.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Vector-borne diseases and malnutrition will rise due to climate change | WHO projects malaria transmission zones will expand and malnutrition could increase by 10–20% by 2050 in Africa | WHO (2021), \"Climate change and health\" | citation |\n| 2 | Surveillance and resilient infrastructure are central to adaptation | Review highlights the importance of early-warning systems and climate-resilient health infrastructure | The Lancet Countdown 2022 Report: sub-Saharan Africa profile | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections based on IPCC RCP4.5–8.5 climate models and WHO health burden estimates  \n- Data limitations: Regional estimates lack local granularity; future funding and governance unknown  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence that climate change will increase disease and health burden; moderate confidence in adaptation feasibility due to system variability\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Scale up integrated climate-health surveillance and early-warning systems  \n2. Invest in climate-resilient health infrastructure and workforce training  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Vector-borne diseases: illnesses spread by insects like mosquitoes (e.g., malaria, dengue)  \n- Resilient infrastructure: buildings and systems designed to function during climate stresses (e.g., floods, heatwaves)",
