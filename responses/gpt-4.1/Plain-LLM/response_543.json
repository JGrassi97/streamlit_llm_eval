  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow is climate change expected to impact the overall health and well-being of communities in the European Mediterranean by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is expected to increase heat-related illnesses, water scarcity, and vector-borne diseases, worsening overall health and well-being in the European Mediterranean by 2035.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, the European Mediterranean region is projected to face increased health risks due to climate change, including more frequent and intense heatwaves, reduced water availability, and higher exposure to vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus. Vulnerable populations—including elderly persons, children, and those with pre-existing conditions—will be disproportionately affected. Key drivers are rising mean temperatures, prolonged droughts, and ecosystem shifts enabling the spread of disease vectors. There are opportunities to reduce risks through urban planning, health system adaptation, and early-warning systems, but without mitigation and adaptation, the region faces significant health and societal challenges.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased heat-related illnesses are likely | Up to 30% rise in heat-related deaths in Southern Europe projected by 2035 | Romanello et al., The Lancet Countdown 2023 | Citation |\n| 2 | Water scarcity will worsen | Mediterranean basin identified as a climate change \"hotspot\" with increased drought risk | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, 2021 | Citation |\n| 3 | Risks from vector-borne diseases will rise | Expansion of Aedes mosquito habitat and West Nile virus incidence seen in past 20 years | European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2023 | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based mainly on \"high emission\" (RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5) and \"mid-range\" scenarios  \n- Data limitations: Sub-regional impacts, precise incidence rates, and local adaptation efforts may differ  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate to high confidence in increased heat and drought impacts; moderate confidence in disease risk expansion\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Strengthen local health systems and early-warning networks for heatwaves and disease outbreaks  \n2. Invest in water conservation infrastructure and climate-adaptive urban planning\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Vector-borne diseases\" are illnesses spread by insects like mosquitoes.  \n- \"Heat-related illnesses\" include health problems like heatstroke that happen when temperatures get very high.",
