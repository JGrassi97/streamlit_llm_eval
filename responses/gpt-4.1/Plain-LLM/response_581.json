  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate variability impact sovereign credit risk for nations heavily dependent on agriculture in Central America by 2040? (Location: Latitude 14.6349, Longitude -90.5069)\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate variability is likely to increase sovereign credit risk for Central American nations reliant on agriculture by raising economic volatility, reducing fiscal stability, and increasing exposure to climate shocks by 2040.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nCentral American countries with economies heavily reliant on agriculture could face heightened sovereign credit risk by 2040 due to projected increases in climate variability. Key drivers include greater frequency and severity of droughts, floods, and temperature extremes—leading to more frequent crop failures, reduced export earnings, and fiscal strain from emergency response or reconstruction. This can weaken government revenues and worsen debt metrics, while also raising the cost of capital due to perceptions of elevated climate risk. Opportunities exist for risk mitigation through agricultural adaptation, diversification, and improved disaster risk management, but lack of investment or institutional constraints may limit these efforts, amplifying credit vulnerability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased climate variability threatens agricultural output in Central America | IPCC assessment reports project increased frequency of extreme weather affecting crop yields | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report | Citation |\n| 2 | Higher climate risk can negatively affect sovereign credit ratings | Moody’s and S&P have cited climate exposure in recent sovereign credit assessments for agriculture-dependent countries | Moody’s, S&P Public Reports | Citation |\n| 3 | Agriculture is a substantial component of GDP and exports in Central America | World Bank data shows >10% GDP and >30% employment in agriculture for nations like Guatemala and Honduras | World Bank Data (databank.worldbank.org) | Numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: RCP4.5-8.5 emissions scenarios; actual economic impacts depend on adaptation investment and global mitigation effectiveness  \n- Data limitations: Limited sub-national projections for crop/sectoral impacts; macroeconomic projections uncertain beyond 2030  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in exposure to climate shocks; moderate confidence in sovereign credit impact magnitude\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Diversify agricultural production and invest in climate-resilient crops and practices  \n2. Strengthen disaster risk financing, early warning systems, and fiscal buffers to manage climate shocks\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Sovereign credit risk: The chance that a nation may not be able to pay back its debts in full or on time  \n- Climate variability: Fluctuations in weather and climate patterns, such as more frequent droughts or floods",
