  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will climate change affect the long-term risk projections for infrastructure investments in Agadir, Morocco by 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2050, climate change is expected to increase risks to infrastructure in Agadir due to greater heat, water stress, and more frequent extreme weather events.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nInfrastructure investments in Agadir face mounting long-term risks from climate change, primarily due to projected higher average temperatures, increased frequency and severity of heatwaves, and greater water scarcity. Coastal flood risk may rise modestly, but drought and water supply stress are expected to be the dominant threats. Infrastructure lifespans and operating costs will be affected, especially for water-dependent systems, electrical grids, and coastal assets. Adaptation measures, such as climate-resilient design and water efficiency, present key opportunities to mitigate these risks and safeguard investment returns.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average annual temperature in Morocco could rise by 2–3°C by 2050 | World Bank projections and IPCC models for North Africa | https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/morocco/climate-data-projections | numeric |\n| 2 | Severe drought and water scarcity expected to intensify in southern Morocco | \"Extreme droughts are projected to become more frequent in Morocco by mid-century\" | https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2023/03/13/water-scarcity-in-morocco-making-every-drop-count | citation |\n| 3 | Increased urban heat risk and pressure on electrical infrastructure | Urban heat island effect amplifies rising temperatures in cities | https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/resources/spm-headline-statements/ | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections based on RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios; actual warming and precipitation may vary.  \n- Data limitations: Local impact models for Agadir specifically are limited; regional data extrapolated.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature and drought trends; medium confidence in local flood risk projections.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Integrate climate resilience into new infrastructure planning (e.g., heat-resilient materials, water-saving technologies).  \n2. Conduct regular climate risk assessments and update investment strategies based on evolving climate data.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- RCP4.5 and RCP8.5: Climate scenarios representing different levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  \n- Urban heat island effect: Cities tend to be warmer than surrounding areas due to buildings and pavement absorbing heat.",
