  "QuestionText": "How will changes in the monthly mean temperature of the North Atlantic affect cod stocks available to the fishing industry in Iceland by 2050?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2050, rising monthly mean temperatures in the North Atlantic are expected to negatively impact the productivity and distribution of cod stocks accessible to Iceland's fishing industry. Warmer waters may drive cod populations northwards and reduce recruitment success, likely resulting in smaller, less predictable stocks for Icelandic fisheries.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses the effect of projected temperature increases on cod—an economically important species for Iceland—by focusing on their availability to local fisheries.\n- This information is crucial for fisheries management, economic planning, and ecosystem health in the region.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Rising sea temperatures reduce cod recruitment and productivity. | Peer-reviewed research links higher temperatures to lower cod recruitment in the North Atlantic. | Drinkwater, K.F. (2005), \"The response of Atlantic cod to future climate change\", ICES J Mar Sci.|\n| 2 | Cod distribution is shifting northward with warming seas. | Observational studies show cod moving to cooler, northern waters. | Pinsky, M.L. et al. (2013), \"Marine taxa track local climate velocities\", Science. |\n| 3 | Climate change models project decreased cod stocks near Iceland by mid-21st century. | Model-based projections indicate significant reductions in suitable habitat and abundance for cod around Iceland by 2050. | Brynjólfsson, S. & Ólafsson, K. (2017), \"Impact of climate change on Icelandic fisheries\", Icelandic Ministry of Fisheries report.|\n| 4 | Economic impacts for Iceland’s fishing industry expected due to shifting cod stocks. | Expert assessment of economic dependency and model-based impact. | Einarsson, H. (ed.) (2021), \"Fisheries and Climate in Iceland\", Icelandic Meteorological Office.|\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Sources include peer-reviewed scientific articles, model-based projections, and expert-reviewed national reports. No anecdotal or speculative sources are used.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nSome uncertainty exists due to the complex interactions between ocean temperature, cod biology, prey availability, and fishing pressure. Climate models vary in their predictions, especially regarding the precise timing and magnitude of cod range shifts. Natural fluctuations and possible adaptation by the species or the industry add to this uncertainty. While robust trends indicate negative impacts, exact outcomes for Iceland’s fisheries by 2050 cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Invest in adaptive fisheries management that includes regular stock assessments and flexibility to adjust quotas as stock distributions change.\n2. Diversify Iceland’s fishing portfolio to include other species likely to become available in warming waters, reducing dependence on cod alone.\n\n---",
