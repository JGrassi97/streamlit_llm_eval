  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will future climate conditions impact the mix of renewable energy sources in Germany by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFuture climate changes will likely increase the share of solar and wind power in Germany, while hydropower and bioenergy may face additional constraints by 2035.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, climate projections suggest that Germany will experience warmer temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather, enhancing solar photovoltaic output and potentially wind generation, especially in northern regions. However, decreased summer rainfall and heatwaves may reduce hydropower generation and limit bioenergy by affecting crop yields and water availability. Opportunities lie in expanding solar and wind, while risks include increased intermittency and reduced reliability from hydropower and bioenergy. Energy planners must adapt grid infrastructure and diversify resources to maintain supply security under changing climate conditions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Solar and wind resources are projected to become more favorable overall | Studies project a 5–10% increase in solar PV potential and stable or slightly higher wind capacity due to changing climate conditions in Germany | Tong et al. (2022), Nature Communications; Zappa et al. (2019), Renewable Energy | Citation |\n| 2 | Hydropower potential may decline due to reduced summer rainfall and river flows | Projections indicate summer river discharge may decrease by up to 30% in some German rivers by 2050, affecting hydroelectric output | Hattermann et al. (2017), Hydrology and Earth System Sciences | Citation |\n| 3 | Bioenergy yields could be impacted by heat and drought stress | Increased drought frequency may reduce yields of energy crops such as maize or miscanthus | Reuters, 2018; German Environment Agency (UBA) | Text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Impacts depend on greenhouse gas emission scenarios and regional climate model outputs for Central Europe  \n- Data limitations: Projections involve uncertainty about exact regional patterns and technological adaptation  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate to high confidence for general trends, lower confidence for precise magnitude in 2035\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize investment in solar PV and wind infrastructure, considering projected resource enhancements.  \n2. Develop adaptation strategies for hydropower and bioenergy, such as water-saving technologies and drought-resistant crops.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Photovoltaic (PV): Technology that turns sunlight into electricity using solar cells.  \n- Hydropower: Using moving water (e.g., rivers) to generate electricity.",
