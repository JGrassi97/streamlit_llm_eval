  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the key public health planning considerations related to climate change for cities in the Great Lakes region of North America?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nKey public health considerations include heat waves, air and water quality, vector-borne diseases, extreme weather, and impacts on mental health and vulnerable populations.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nCities in the Great Lakes region face climate-induced public health risks such as more frequent heat waves, deteriorating air and water quality, increased risk of disease from mosquitoes and ticks, greater frequency of severe storms, flooding, and impacts on mental health. Vulnerable populations—including children, older adults, low-income, and those with chronic diseases—are at heightened risk. Key drivers of risk are rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather. Opportunities exist to improve preparedness through improved disease surveillance, heat action plans, green infrastructure, and stronger public health communication. Risks include overwhelmed health services, infrastructure damage, and unequal health impacts if not proactively addressed.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heat waves are increasing and cause higher rates of heat-related illness and death in the region | “Extreme heat events in the Midwest are projected to increase in frequency, severity, and duration, with direct implications for public health.” | USGCRP, 2018: Fourth National Climate Assessment, Vol. II, Ch. 21: Midwest | citation |\n| 2 | Water quality is at risk due to heavier rainfall and flooding, increasing exposure to pathogens | “Heavy precipitation increases the risk of sewer overflows, potentially contaminating drinking and recreational waters.” | CDC: Climate and Health - Midwest | citation |\n| 3 | Climate change enhances the range and activity of disease vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks | \"The distributions of ticks that carry Lyme disease and mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus have expanded in the Midwest due to climate warming.\" | CDC: Climate and Health - Midwest; EPA, 2021: Climate Change Impacts in the Great Lakes Region | citation |\n| 4 | Vulnerable populations are at greater risk to climate-related health effects | “Populations at greatest risk include children, the elderly, those with chronic illness, low income, or social isolation.” | USGCRP (2016): The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections depend on emissions, land use, and adaptation actions  \n- Data limitations: Regional projections may not fully capture city-level variations  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in increased heat waves and vector-borne diseases; moderate confidence regarding magnitude of water quality impacts\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Develop and implement local heat action plans and early warning systems for extreme weather.  \n2. Enhance disease monitoring and strengthen infrastructure to reduce water and air quality risks.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Vector-borne diseases\" = illnesses transmitted by insects like mosquitoes and ticks  \n- \"Green infrastructure\" = nature-based solutions (e.g., parks, wetlands) to manage heat and water issues  ",
