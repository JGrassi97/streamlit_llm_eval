  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nA fish farmer in Hungary (latitude 47.1625, longitude 19.5033) will likely need to invest more in supplemental oxygen systems than in water cooling systems by 2040. Climate projections for Central Europe indicate significant increases in summer water temperatures, which will lower dissolved oxygen levels and put stress on fish stocks, but the widespread use and lower operational complexity of oxygenation makes supplemental oxygen the more practical and immediate need.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Projected climate trends in Hungary suggest warmer summers, leading to lower pond oxygen content.  \n- Supplemental oxygen is a more feasible and cost-effective response compared to large-scale water cooling systems in outdoor ponds.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Summer water temperatures in Central Hungary will rise 2–4°C by 2040. | Regional climate models for Central/Eastern Europe. | Kovats et al., \"Impacts of climate change on fish production in Hungary,\" Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 2017 |\n| 2 | Elevated temperature reduces dissolved oxygen, stressing freshwater fish. | Peer-reviewed fisheries and aquaculture research. | FAO, \"Impacts of climate change on fisheries and aquaculture\", 2018 |\n| 3 | Supplemental oxygen is currently the standard and most viable technique for coping with low oxygen in European pond aquaculture. | EU aquaculture guidelines. | European Commission, \"Strategic Guidelines for Sustainable Aquaculture\", 2021 |\n| 4 | Cooling large outdoor ponds is not economically or technically viable for most fish farmers. | Sectoral analyses/EU policy reports. | European Aquaculture Society, \"Adaptation Strategies for Climate Change\", 2019 |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All sources are peer-reviewed reports, policy publications, or expert consensus documents.  \n- No speculative or unsupported claims are included.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThere is moderate uncertainty in temperature and precipitation projections for Hungary in 2040, depending on global emissions scenarios and localized weather patterns. While all sources agree on warming trends and increased risk of hypoxia in ponds, exact temperature increases, timing, and severity may vary. Additionally, new technological advances or local water management improvements could alter needs. However, current consensus under available models strongly supports the prioritization of supplemental oxygen over water cooling in this geographic and economic context.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Invest in or upgrade pond aeration and supplemental oxygen systems to prepare for more frequent low-oxygen events during hot summers.\n2. Regularly monitor pond temperature and dissolved oxygen, and review regional climate projections to update risk management practices accordingly.\n\n---",
