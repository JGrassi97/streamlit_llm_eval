  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected impact of climate change on energy infrastructure resilience in coastal Louisiana, USA, over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is projected to significantly increase risks of flooding, storm damage, and operational disruptions to energy infrastructure in coastal Louisiana over the next 20 years.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nCoastal Louisiana’s energy infrastructure—including refineries, pipelines, and power generation facilities—is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, especially more frequent extreme storms, accelerated sea-level rise, and coastal erosion. These factors are likely to cause increased flooding, equipment damage, and service interruptions. Rising temperatures may also reduce power plant efficiency and increase cooling demands. Key risks include economic losses, potential spills, and grid instability. Opportunities exist to enhance resilience through hardening infrastructure, elevating critical assets, and adopting more distributed and renewable energy systems. However, high uncertainty remains regarding the rate of sea level rise and storm intensity, complicating adaptation planning.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Louisiana’s energy infrastructure is highly exposed to flood and storm risks worsened by climate change. | \"Over 40% of U.S. oil refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, where hurricane and flooding risk is increasing due to climate change.\" | U.S. Department of Energy, Climate Change and the U.S. Energy Sector: Regional Vulnerabilities and Resilience Solutions (2015) | citation |\n| 2 | Sea-level rise and coastal erosion are expected to disrupt critical energy facilities. | \"Louisiana is losing a football field of land every 100 minutes, increasing vulnerability of energy assets to inundation.\" | Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA), Coastal Master Plan (2017) | citation |\n| 3 | Infrastructure hardening and adaptation measures can mitigate some projected impacts. | \"Elevating substations and floodproofing facilities are identified as effective resilience strategies.\" | U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Energy Sector Vulnerabilities to Climate Change (2013) | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Impacts depend on climate scenarios (e.g., RCP 4.5 vs. RCP 8.5) and adaptation actions taken.  \n- Data limitations: Infrastructure vulnerability assessments may lack detail at the asset-level; future sea-level and storm trends remain uncertain.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in increased flood and storm risk; moderate confidence in severity and local adaptation effectiveness.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize mapping and fortifying critical energy infrastructure vulnerable to flooding and storm surge.  \n2. Incorporate climate adaptation into infrastructure planning, including elevating assets and diversifying energy sources (e.g., solar/microgrids).\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Resilience\" refers to the ability of infrastructure to withstand and recover from disruptions.\n- \"RCP\" or Representative Concentration Pathways are scenarios of greenhouse gas concentrations used in climate modeling.",
