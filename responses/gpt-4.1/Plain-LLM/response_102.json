  "QuestionText": "How will hotter conditions affect the post-harvest handling and storage requirements for agricultural products in India over the next two decades?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nHotter conditions in India over the next two decades are likely to put significant stress on the post-harvest handling and storage of agricultural products. Increases in temperature can accelerate spoilage, increase pest and disease risk, and reduce the shelf life of perishables. To adapt, there will be a greater need for improved cooling, rapid processing, and investment in cold chain infrastructure.  \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses the challenges of storing and handling crops as temperatures rise at coordinates relevant to India.  \n- Relevant for policymakers, agribusinesses, and farmers needing resilient post-harvest systems to reduce losses and maintain food security.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Higher temperatures will increase post-harvest losses due to faster spoilage and pest activity. | Literature and case studies show spoilage rates double for every 10°C rise; India already loses ~30–40% of fruits and vegetables post-harvest. | FAO (2017); ICAR Reports |\n| 2 | More cooling and cold chain investment will be needed as traditional storage becomes less effective. | Studies indicate current cold storage capacity is inadequate (covers only about 10% of produce); climate projections suggest higher demand. | Indian National Centre for Cold Chain Development (NCCD); World Bank (2021) |\n| 3 | Need for rapid processing and improved packaging to extend shelf life under higher temperatures. | Expert recommendations and pilot projects have shown reduced spoilage where better handling and packaging are implemented. | ICAR-Indian Institute of Horticultural Research |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Major sources include peer-reviewed studies, government agency reports, and international organizations such as the FAO and World Bank.\n- Evidence is based on published research and expert consensus, not speculation.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nSome uncertainty exists around the pace and exact extent of temperature increases, as well as the success of adaptation strategies (such as expansion of cold chains and adoption by smallholders). Regional variation is likely, and future policies, technological advances, and financial investments could either worsen or mitigate projected impacts. Evidence for post-harvest loss rates is robust, but data on adaptation efficacy is still emerging.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Invest in expanding and upgrading cold chain infrastructure (e.g., solar-powered cold storage, efficient transportation) to reduce spoilage under hotter conditions.\n2. Provide training and incentives for farmers and handlers to adopt rapid post-harvest processing and improved packaging techniques designed for higher temperature environments.\n\n---",
