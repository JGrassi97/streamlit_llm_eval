  "QuestionText": "What are the broad financial risks posed by climate change to the real estate market in South Florida, USA, over the next 30 years?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the broad financial risks posed by climate change to the real estate market in South Florida, USA, over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is expected to drive significant financial risks to South Florida’s real estate market via rising insurance costs, property devaluation, increased flood damage, and impaired mortgage viability.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next 30 years, climate change poses multiple financial risks to the South Florida real estate market, particularly from sea-level rise, increased frequency and severity of coastal flooding, and more intense hurricanes. These threats directly impact property values, raise insurance premiums, and may render some properties uninsurable or unsellable. Increased damages may lead to higher default rates on mortgages and reduced investment in the region. The risk profile may vary significantly based on location (e.g., coastal properties face higher risks). Insurance market shifts and tighter lending requirements are likely. Overall, these challenges threaten the long-term liquidity, valuation, and stability of South Florida real estate.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Flood risk is increasing in South Florida due to sea-level rise. | NOAA reports a measured rate of sea-level rise in SE Florida, projecting 10-17 inches by 2040-2060. | NOAA Sea Level Rise Technical Report (2022) | Numeric |\n| 2 | Insurance costs are rising, and some insurers have left the Florida market due to increasing climate risk. | Major private insurers have reduced coverage or exited the FL market; citizens property insurance policies rose to ~1.3 million in 2023. | Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (public briefings) | Numeric/Text |\n| 3 | Mortgage lenders are beginning to consider flood risk and climate exposure for risk assessment in South Florida. | Freddie Mac’s climate-risk evaluation guidance notes exposure of South FL mortgages to sea-level rise and recurrent flooding. | Freddie Mac (official disclosures 2022) | Citation |\n| 4 | Property values in flood-prone areas of South Florida are showing a trend of slower appreciation relative to less-exposed areas. | Studies indicate a “climate discount” on properties with higher flood risk. | “Climate change and coastal real estate” (Harvard, 2020) | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Sea-level rise projections and insurance market trends are sensitive to policy and emissions scenarios.  \n- Data limitations: Long-term economic modeling is limited by changing regulatory, demographic, and technological factors.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in increased insurance cost, moderate confidence on magnitude of property value impact.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Real estate stakeholders should perform location-specific climate risk assessments when buying or investing.  \n2. Policymakers should consider updating floodplain regulations and expand climate adaptation infrastructure financing.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Sea-level rise”: Gradual increase in average ocean level due to climate change.  \n- “Uninsurable/unsellable”: Properties for which owners cannot find insurance or buyers, usually due to excessive risk.",
