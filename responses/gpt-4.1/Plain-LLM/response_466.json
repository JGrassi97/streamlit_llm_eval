  "QuestionText": "How could evolving climate patterns affect the development of wind and solar power in India over the next 30 years?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving climate patterns affect the development of wind and solar power in India over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nChanging climate patterns could alter wind speeds and solar radiation, potentially impacting the reliability and geographic distribution of wind and solar power in India.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next 30 years, evolving climate patterns in India are expected to cause regional shifts in wind speeds and solar irradiation, which could both positively and negatively affect wind and solar power development. For solar, increasing temperatures and altered cloud cover may reduce efficiency in some areas, while expanding potential in others. Wind power may see changes in resource distribution, with some regions experiencing higher variability or reduced speeds. Key risks include increased extreme weather, threatening infrastructure, but opportunities exist to optimize project siting to adapt to new patterns. Proactive planning, diversified portfolios, and climate-resilient designs will be critical to maintain and grow renewable energy output amid changing conditions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Climate change may decrease wind energy potential in some regions while increasing it elsewhere in India. | \"Projected changes in mean wind speed under RCP8.5 indicate a decrease over northern and central India and an increase in Tamil Nadu by the end of the 21st century.\" | \"Impacts of climate change on wind energy potential in the Indian subcontinent,\" Current Science, 2018 | Citation |\n| 2 | Solar photovoltaic performance may decline marginally due to temperature rise but is more sensitive to changes in sunlight and cloudiness. | \"Increasing temperature is projected to decrease the efficiency of solar panels by ~0.4–0.5% per degree Celsius.\" | \"Impact of Climate Change on Renewable Energy Resource Potential in India,\" Energy Policy, 2015 | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Outcomes depend heavily on greenhouse gas emission pathways and regional monsoon changes (e.g. RCP4.5 vs. RCP8.5).\n- Data limitations: Regional granularity of projections varies, and local microclimatic effects are not always captured.\n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in direction of trends; magnitude of effects remains uncertain.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Regularly update wind and solar resource assessments using high-resolution regional climate projections.  \n2. Invest in flexible grid infrastructure and storage to buffer increased variability in renewable output.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"RCP8.5\" refers to a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario used in climate modeling.  \n- \"Solar irradiation\" means the amount of sunlight energy reaching the Earth's surface.",
