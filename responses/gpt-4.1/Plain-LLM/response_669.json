  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat impact might expected temperature changes have on energy demand in Cairo, Egypt over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures are likely to significantly increase electricity demand in Cairo, mainly due to greater cooling (air conditioning) needs.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAs average temperatures in Cairo are projected to rise over the next 20 years due to climate change, demand for electricity—especially for air conditioning—will increase, particularly during summer months. Studies show that in hot regions, every 1°C increase can result in a 5–20% rise in cooling-related energy consumption. This growing demand could strain electricity infrastructure, raise fuel imports or generation needs, and pose risks of blackouts if not addressed. However, promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption offers opportunities to meet growing demand sustainably and reduce climate impacts.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Temperatures in Cairo are projected to rise by 1.5–2.5°C by 2040 | IPCC Sixth Assessment reports regional projections for North Africa; World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal shows similar trends | https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/egypt/climate-data-projections | citation |\n| 2 | Each 1°C increase in temperature can boost electricity demand for cooling by 5–20% in hot climates | IEA (International Energy Agency) reports on cooling demand trends in MENA | https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling | citation |\n| 3 | Air conditioning is a primary driver of peak electricity demand in Cairo's summers | Egypt’s national statistics and World Bank regional energy reviews | https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/06/07/powering-egypt-s-clean-energy-future | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes current emissions trajectory (RCP4.5–RCP8.5), population growth, and economic trends continue  \n- Data limitations: Limited city-specific projections for Cairo; national/regional data extrapolated  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in warming trend and likely impact on cooling demand; moderate confidence in magnitude of demand increase\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in grid upgrades and renewable energy to accommodate higher peak demand.  \n2. Promote building energy efficiency measures and more efficient cooling technologies to reduce electricity consumption growth.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"RCP4.5–RCP8.5\": These are standard climate change scenarios representing different greenhouse gas emission levels.\n- \"IEA\": Stands for International Energy Agency, an international organization that studies energy trends.",
