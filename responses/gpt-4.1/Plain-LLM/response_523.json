  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nProjected climate change poses substantial risks to the long-term viability of communities in the Canadian Arctic, including those near latitude 63.7467, longitude -96.797. By mid-century, expected impacts include permafrost thaw, altered ecosystems, reduced reliability of traditional food sources, and infrastructure challenges, all of which threaten social, economic, and cultural stability.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses the viability of Arctic Canadian communities by highlighting expected physical, ecological, and socioeconomic impacts.\n- This information matters for community leaders, planners, and residents seeking to plan for adaptation and safeguard livelihoods and heritage.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim                                                         | Evidence                                                                                           | Source                                                         |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Permafrost thaw will disrupt infrastructure and traditional land use | “Permafrost degradation affects transportation, buildings, and community safety.”                    | IPCC AR6 WG2: North America, 2022                             |\n| 2 | Changing wildlife patterns threaten food security and cultural practices | \"Warming alters animal migration and abundance critical to Indigenous food systems.\"                 | Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SR1.5, 2018  |\n| 3 | Increased risk of flooding and shoreline erosion in coastal and near-coastal regions | \"Thawing permafrost and sea ice loss contribute to coastal erosion that threatens settlements.\"     | Government of Canada, Canada in a Changing Climate, 2021      |\n| 4 | Community health may decline due to infrastructure damage and ecosystem changes | \"Climate change can exacerbate health impacts by affecting water, sanitation, and food access.\"      | Health Canada, Climate Change and Health, 2019                |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Sources are primarily peer-reviewed global assessments (IPCC reports) or government science assessments, reviewed by multiple subject-matter experts.\n- Claims are based on current scientific consensus, regional reports, and observed trends.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile the outlined risks are broadly supported by high-quality sources, there are important uncertainties. The rate of permafrost thaw and the specific effects on individual communities depend on the progression of global greenhouse gas emissions, local geography, and adaptive measures taken. The severity and exact timing of impacts such as food insecurity or infrastructure damage are influenced by complex interactions not wholly predictable with current models. Data specific to precise coordinates or individual communities may be limited, with most assessments providing regional trends.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Prioritize adaptation planning that includes infrastructure reinforcement, updated building standards for permafrost regions, and support for traditional food systems.\n2. Expand local and Indigenous-led monitoring programs to track environmental changes and improve community-level decision-making.\n\n---",
