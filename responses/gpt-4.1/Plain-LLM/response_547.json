  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate change influence the burden of disease in Central Asian nations over the next 20 to 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change will likely increase the burden of infectious, respiratory, and heat-related diseases in Central Asia due to rising temperatures, water scarcity, and extreme weather events.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nCentral Asian nations face increasing health risks from climate change over the next 20–30 years, including elevated rates of vector-borne (e.g., malaria, West Nile), waterborne (e.g., diarrheal), and respiratory illnesses linked to worsening air quality and dust storms. Higher temperatures and more frequent heatwaves will disproportionately affect children, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions. Water scarcity from glacial melt and droughts may amplify the risk of malnutrition and disease outbreaks. The overall impact depends on public health adaptation, infrastructure resilience, and regional cooperation. Proactive policies and surveillance offer opportunities to reduce vulnerability and protect population health.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased risk of vector- and waterborne diseases due to higher temperatures and changing precipitation | \"Malaria transmission zones may expand northward into Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as temperatures rise.\" | Imasheva et al., \"Assessing the impacts of climate change on malaria in Central Asia,\" PLOS ONE, 2021 | citation |\n| 2 | Dust storms and worsening air pollution raise respiratory health risks | \"Central Asia's frequency of dust storms is projected to increase, worsening respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD.\" | World Bank, \"Climate Risk Country Profile: Uzbekistan,\" 2021 | citation |\n| 3 | Heatwaves and droughts threaten food and water security, impacting nutrition and disease | “Heat-related mortality is expected to increase, especially among young children and elderly people.” | WHO, \"Climate change and health in Central Asia: health impact assessment and adaptation strategies,\" 2017 | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Disease projections depend on greenhouse gas emission scenarios, adaptation policies, and health infrastructure investment.  \n- Data limitations: Limited local disease surveillance and climate-health research in Central Asia restricts specificity of projections.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate-to-high confidence in direction of risk increase; exact magnitude remains uncertain due to adaptation capacity and incomplete data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Strengthen disease surveillance and early warning systems for climate-sensitive conditions.  \n2. Invest in resilient water and healthcare infrastructure to reduce vulnerability to climate-related health risks.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Vector-borne disease: Illnesses transmitted by mosquitoes or other insects.\n- COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a chronic lung condition causing breathing difficulties.",
