  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will evolving temperature conditions affect the efficiency of geothermal plants in the East African Rift, Ethiopia by mid-century?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nModerate increases in surface temperatures by mid-century are unlikely to significantly reduce geothermal plant efficiency in the East African Rift, Ethiopia.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nGeothermal plants in Ethiopia’s East African Rift primarily rely on deep underground heat sources, making them relatively resilient to changes in surface temperature. Current climate models project regional surface warming of 1.5–2.5°C by 2050, but this is unlikely to have a marked impact on reservoir temperatures at depths used for geothermal energy. Efficiency losses may be minimal or negligible, though extreme surface heat could marginally increase cooling requirements for surface equipment. Overall, geothermal power remains a robust energy option for the region in the face of projected mid-century climate warming, but site-specific monitoring is advisable to track rare local anomalies or infrastructure vulnerabilities.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Geothermal plant efficiency mainly depends on deep reservoir temperature | \"Geothermal power generation is dominantly influenced by the relatively stable subsurface temperature, not ambient atmospheric temperature.\" | DiPippo, R. (2016). Geothermal Power Plants: Principles, Applications, Case Studies and Environmental Impact. | Citation |\n| 2 | Projected surface warming in Ethiopia is 1.5–2.5°C by 2050 | \"Surface air temperatures for Ethiopia are projected to rise by 1.5–2.5°C by mid-century (2040–2069)\" | World Bank, Climate Change Knowledge Portal (2023). | Numeric |\n| 3 | Surface temperature rise is unlikely to significantly affect geothermal reservoir temperature at typical depths | \"Impacts of surface climate change on deep geothermal resource productivity are negligible at depths >1km.\" | Fridleifsson, I.B. et al. (2008). The possible role and contribution of geothermal energy to the mitigation of climate change. | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on RCP4.5–RCP8.5 temperature projections, not considering extreme outlier scenarios.  \n- Data limitations: Limited long-term observational data on coupled effects of surface temperature rise and geothermal reservoir performance in the region.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence that deep geothermal efficiency is robust to modeled surface temperature changes.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in site-specific monitoring of geothermal plant thermal performance and cooling systems as temperatures rise.  \n2. Design or retrofit surface cooling systems to accommodate modest increases in ambient temperature if needed.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Reservoir temperature” refers to the heat stored deep underground, which geothermal plants tap for energy.  \n- “RCP4.5–RCP8.5” are scenarios used to project future climate based on greenhouse gas emissions.",
