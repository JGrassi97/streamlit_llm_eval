  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving wind patterns affect financial risk planning in Oujda, Morocco during 2020-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nChanging wind patterns may alter risks to infrastructure, energy production, and agriculture, which should be accounted for in Oujda's financial planning through adaptive risk management.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nEvolving wind patterns in Oujda, Morocco could significantly influence financial risk planning between 2020 and 2050. Potential impacts include increased variability in wind energy production, heightened exposure of infrastructure to wind-related damage, and altered agricultural conditions due to shifts in soil erosion or water distribution. These may create new liabilities or reduce revenue predictability for local businesses and government. To manage this risk, planners should update climate risk assessments, diversify energy strategies, and consider insurance or contingency mechanisms for wind-related events. Proactively integrating wind pattern forecasts into planning can help mitigate negative financial impacts and leverage any emerging opportunities, like increased wind energy potential.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Wind variability impacts energy production reliability in Morocco | \"Sustained wind regimes are crucial for energy production; changes affect energy yields.\" | IRENA (2019), “Renewable Energy Prospects for Morocco”: https://www.irena.org/DigitalArticles/2019/Apr/Morocco-Renewable-Energy-Profiles | Citation |\n| 2 | Climate projections indicate increased wind variability and frequency of extreme wind events in North Africa | \"Ensemble climate models project increased wind speed variability and extremes in North Africa through mid-century.\" | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2021): https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/ | Citation |\n| 3 | Wind-induced erosion affects agricultural productivity | \"Wind erosion is a significant cause of land degradation in eastern Morocco.\" | FAO (2020), “Morocco — Land and Water Resources”: https://www.fao.org/3/ca7049en/CA7049EN.pdf | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on ensemble climate model projections with moderate-to-high greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., RCP4.5–RCP8.5)  \n- Data limitations: Limited long-term wind pattern data specific to Oujda; reliance on regional and national studies  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in increase of wind variability and related risks through 2050\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Integrate updated regional climate and wind pattern projections into all infrastructure and energy investment plans.  \n2. Diversify energy sources and invest in wind-resilient infrastructure and agriculture insurance schemes.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Ensemble climate models\": Collections of several climate simulations used together to improve reliability of projections.  \n- \"RCP4.5–RCP8.5\": Scenarios representing moderate and high future greenhouse gas emissions, used in climate studies.",
