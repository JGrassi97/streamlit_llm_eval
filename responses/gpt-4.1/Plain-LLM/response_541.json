  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate trends challenge public health infrastructure in the major urban centers of Brazil by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate trends are likely to increase disease burden, heat stress, and infrastructure strain in Brazil’s major cities by 2040.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, rising temperatures, more frequent extreme weather events, and higher rainfall variability may intensify urban health challenges in Brazilian cities. These climate trends could lead to higher rates of vector-borne diseases (e.g., dengue), heat-related illness, floods, and disruptions to basic utilities like water and sanitation. Rapid urbanization, social inequality, and inadequate existing infrastructure further heighten risks. Key opportunities lie in enhancing public health surveillance, resilient health care systems, and adaptive city planning, but the main risk is if systems are not upgraded, resulting in overwhelmed hospitals and increased mortality from avoidable causes.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Climate change is projected to increase dengue risk in Brazil | Projections show dengue transmission could rise by up to 20% under warming scenarios by 2040 | Lowe et al., Lancet Planet Health, 2018; World Bank \"Climate Risk Country Profile: Brazil\", 2021 | Citation | \n| 2 | Urban centers like São Paulo face increased flood risk from extreme rainfall | Data show a potential increase in annual extreme precipitation events, elevating flood risk and straining sanitation infrastructure | Nobre et al., Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 2016; World Bank, 2021 | Citation |\n| 3 | High temperatures will increase heat-related illness and deaths | Studies indicate that a 2°C rise in temperature could double heat-related mortality rates in São Paulo | Braga et al., Environmental Health Perspectives, 2002; IBGE, 2019 | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections are based on mid- to high-range greenhouse gas emission scenarios (e.g., RCP4.5, RCP8.5)  \n- Data limitations: City-level health system adaptation capacity projections are limited  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trend direction, moderate on magnitude and precise urban impacts\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in early warning systems and vector control to reduce disease outbreaks.  \n2. Upgrade urban drainage and health infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Vector-borne diseases: Illnesses spread by insects like mosquitoes (e.g., dengue).  \n- RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways): Scenarios used to model climate futures based on greenhouse gas emissions.  \n",
