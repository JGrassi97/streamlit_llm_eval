  "QuestionText": "How might changing climate conditions affect the character and profitability of tourism in the national parks of the Western USA by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2040, changing climate conditions in the Western USA’s national parks—such as Yellowstone (at the provided coordinates)—are likely to reshape both visitor experiences and the profitability of tourism. Hotter, drier summers, increased wildfire risk, changes in wildlife patterns, and impacts on park infrastructure are expected to alter when and how tourists visit these parks. While some seasons or months may see decreased visitation due to extreme weather or fire closures, other times may see increased demand as visitors shift their travel patterns. Overall, the profitability of tourism in these parks will depend on how well they adapt to these challenges.\n\n**Key relevance points:**  \n- Direct impact on the character and volume of tourism, which affects park revenues, local economies, and visitor experiences.  \n- Important for planners and stakeholders in tourism, park management, and local businesses to anticipate and respond to climate-driven changes.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table:**  \n| # | Claim                                                                                                  | Evidence                                                         | Source                                                       |\n|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Hotter, drier summers and increased wildfire risk are projected for Western US parks by 2040           | NPS reports, US climate assessments predict more heat and fires  | US National Park Service (Climate Change Reports, nps.gov)   |\n| 2 | Climate change can affect the timing and type of tourism activities (e.g., shorter snow seasons)        | Observed changes in visitor numbers during heatwaves and fires   | US Global Change Research Program (usgcrp.gov, 2018 report)  |\n| 3 | Park infrastructure and access may be threatened by climate impacts, affecting visitor appeal           | Documented road/area closures due to heat, fires, flooding       | NPS Visitor Use Statistics (irma.nps.gov)                    |\n| 4 | Revenue loss during extreme climate events (fire, heat, road closure) has been observed                 | N/A                                                             | N/A                                                         |\n\n**Source quality:**  \n- The sources used are official US government reports, reviewed by subject-matter experts and based on peer-reviewed climate science and historical park management observations.\n- No speculative or anecdotal sources included.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile there is strong consensus that climate change will significantly affect Western US national parks, the specific impacts by 2040 remain uncertain. Uncertainties include the rate of climate change, effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation strategies, possible technological advances, and how visitor preferences may evolve in response. Annual weather can also fluctuate, resulting in better or worse years for tourism independent of long-term trends. Few direct forecasts exist that quantify visitation or profit changes for individual parks over these specific timeframes.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations:**  \n1. Prepare adaptive management plans in national parks to address climate risks—this includes upgrading infrastructure to withstand extreme weather and developing fire response strategies.  \n2. Diversify tourism offerings to spread visitation throughout the year or across more resilient areas to reduce the impact of seasonal extremes and closures.\n\n---",
