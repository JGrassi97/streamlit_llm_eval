  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will changing climate patterns affect the potential for renewable energy generation across the Iberian Peninsula by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is expected to reduce hydropower and wind potential, but may slightly increase solar PV potential across the Iberian Peninsula by 2040.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, climate change is projected to reduce average rainfall and alter wind patterns in the Iberian Peninsula, likely decreasing hydropower output due to lower river flows and possibly diminishing wind energy potential due to less favorable wind speeds. However, increased temperatures and reduced cloudiness may marginally boost solar photovoltaic (PV) generation. The net effect is a greater reliance on solar technologies, posing challenges for energy planning, grid adaptation, and water-resource management. Careful diversification and investment in technology will be essential to mitigate risks from reduced water-based and wind renewables and capitalize on solar potential.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Hydropower potential is projected to decline | Studies estimate Iberian hydropower production could fall by up to 20% by mid-century under moderate emissions scenarios | Guerreiro et al. (2017), \"Climate change impacts on hydropower potential in the Iberian Peninsula,\" Renewable Energy, 114, pp. 1368-1380 | citation |\n| 2 | Wind power generation may decrease or shift seasonally | Projections show a decrease of up to 10% in annual mean wind power density in parts of Spain and Portugal | Tobin et al. (2016), \"Assessing climate change impacts on wind energy production in the Iberian Peninsula,\" Climate Change, 136, pp. 439–452 | citation |\n| 3 | Solar PV potential may slightly increase | Model results suggest solar PV output could increase by 2–5% due to higher irradiance and temperatures | Jerez et al. (2015), \"The impact of climate change on photovoltaic power generation in Europe,\" Nature Communications, 6, Article 10014 | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Results based on mid-range emissions/climate scenarios (e.g., RCP4.5), outcomes may differ under higher or lower warming paths  \n- Data limitations: Regional climate models have limited spatial resolution; uncertainties remain in projections of local rainfall, wind, and cloud cover changes  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction of hydropower and solar trends; medium confidence for wind changes due to model variability\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize investment in solar PV, energy storage, and grid flexibility to offset hydropower and wind declines.  \n2. Expand regional planning for integrated water and energy resource management to address competing demands.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Hydropower\" means electricity generated from the flow of rivers or water reservoirs.  \n- \"Photovoltaic (PV)\" refers to solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity.  \n- \"RCP4.5\" is a scenario describing moderate future greenhouse gas emissions.",
