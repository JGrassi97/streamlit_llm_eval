  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could changes in average winter temperatures affect the demand on the power grid for heating in Moscow, Russia, during the 2040-2050 period?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nMilder average winter temperatures are likely to reduce overall heating demand on Moscow's power grid during 2040-2050.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nWith projected climate warming, Moscow’s winters are expected to become milder by mid-century, reducing the number of very cold days and lowering the total energy needed for heating. This implies decreased demand on the city’s power grid for space heating, leading to potential cost and emissions savings. However, risks include variability between years, possible increases in electricity demand if heat is increasingly provided by electric systems, and the potential for more pronounced temperature swings. Planners should prepare for year-to-year fluctuations and consider how changing heating technologies could change grid impacts.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Moscow is expected to see warmer winters by 2040-2050 | Projections suggest Moscow’s average winter temperatures may rise by 2–3°C by mid-century under moderate emissions scenarios | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2021), Ch. 12; https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch | citation |\n| 2 | Warmer winters decrease heating degree days (HDD), lowering heating demand | Russia’s heating degree days expected to decline, reducing energy for heating | Prokofieva et al., Energy Reports 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2021.07.102) | citation |\n| 3 | Variability and technology shifts may offset some reductions | Shift to electric heating could change grid impacts even as total heating demand drops | IEA, “The Future of Heat Pumps”, 2022 (https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-heat-pumps) | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on mid-range emissions and climate scenarios (e.g., SSP2-4.5)  \n- Data limitations: Future pace of heating technology adoption in Moscow is uncertain  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in general warming trend, moderate confidence in net grid impact due to competing factors\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Update demand forecasts for winter heating to account for milder winters and possible electrification of heating.  \n2. Monitor adoption of electric heating technologies and prepare flexibility measures for potential increases in winter peak electricity loads.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Heating degree days (HDD)” means a measure of how much energy is needed for heating, based on how far daily temperatures fall below a baseline (commonly 18°C).\n- “Electrification of heating” refers to shifting from gas or district heating to electric systems like heat pumps.",
