  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat public health challenges will arise from climate change in the densely populated river deltas of Southeast Asia over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures, flooding, and sea-level rise will increase risks of waterborne, vector-borne diseases, malnutrition, and displacement in Southeast Asian river deltas.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next two decades, climate change in Southeast Asia’s densely populated river deltas—such as the Mekong—will heighten public health risks through flooding, saltwater intrusion, and more frequent extreme weather. These drivers will facilitate the spread of waterborne (e.g., cholera, diarrhea) and vector-borne diseases (e.g., dengue, malaria), threaten food security by damaging crops and fisheries, and increase malnutrition rates. Displacement from land loss and economic disruption will further strain health systems and social stability. Effective adaptation, improved water and sanitation infrastructure, and resilient healthcare responses present key opportunities to mitigate these risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased flooding and sea-level rise threaten water quality and food security in Mekong Delta | The Mekong River Commission projects up to 1 meter sea-level rise by 2100, increasing saltwater intrusion and affecting rice yields | https://www.mrcmekong.org/assets/Publications/technical/Climate-Change-in-the-Lower-Mekong-Basin_final.pdf | numeric |\n| 2 | Climate change is expected to drive up vector-borne diseases (e.g., dengue) in Southeast Asia | WHO and studies project that changes in rainfall, temperature, and urbanization will expand mosquito ranges and increase dengue incidence | https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health | citation |\n| 3 | Food insecurity and malnutrition are likely to rise with increased crop failures due to flooding and weather variability | Studies link delta flooding and saline intrusion with decreased agricultural productivity, threatening food security and nutrition | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5404196/ | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Impacts depend on greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, regional adaptation measures, and global temperature rise (e.g., RCP4.5 vs. RCP8.5).\n- Data limitations: Local disease surveillance and projections can be sparse or delayed; attribution of specific diseases/events to climate change can be complex.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in increased flooding/salinity and disease risks; moderate confidence for exact magnitude of health impacts.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Upgrade water and sanitation infrastructure to withstand flooding and salinity, reducing waterborne disease risk.  \n2. Strengthen surveillance and integrated vector control for early detection and response to disease outbreaks.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Vector-borne diseases: Illnesses transmitted by insects, like mosquitoes (e.g., dengue, malaria).  \n- Saltwater intrusion: When seawater moves into freshwater zones, affecting drinking water and crops.",
