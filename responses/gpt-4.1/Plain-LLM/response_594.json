  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might a shorter, warmer winter affect the business interruption insurance claims for ski resorts in the French Alps over the next decade?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nShorter, warmer winters are likely to increase business interruption insurance claims from ski resorts in the French Alps due to reduced snow reliability and operational days.\n\n### Executive summary (â‰¤ 120 words)  \nA trend toward shorter, warmer winters in the French Alps is expected to reduce the reliability and length of ski seasons, resulting in higher risks of revenue loss for ski resorts. Consequently, ski resorts may file more business interruption insurance claims related to insufficient snow and event cancellations. Insurers may also tighten claim criteria or raise premiums in response to this increased risk. The main drivers are decreased snowfall and a shorter ski season, which affect ski resort operations and visitor numbers. The opportunity for resorts lies in diversifying activities beyond skiing to manage insurance risk and earnings volatility.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Ski season length in the Alps is highly sensitive to temperature and snow reliability | \"Alpine ski resorts are at risk from reductions in natural snowfall and season length\" | N/A | Text |\n| 2 | Business interruption insurance is commonly used by ski resorts to manage weather-related risks | Observable industry practices; specific claims data unavailable without access | N/A | Text |\n| 3 | Warmer winters generally reduce skiable days, impacting resort revenues | \"Reduced snow cover directly affects ski resort operations\" | N/A | Text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes continuation of current warming trends and no major adaptation measures  \n- Data limitations: No access to current claims data or precise regional climate models for the next decade  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence based on widely understood physical and economic relationships; limited by lack of recent quantitative data\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Ski resorts should review and update their business interruption coverage to ensure climate risks are adequately insured.\n2. Invest in alternative activities or year-round tourism models to diversify revenue and reduce insurance dependence.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Business interruption insurance: a type of policy covering lost income when operations are disrupted.  \n- Ski season: The part of the year when there is enough snow to operate ski-related activities.",
