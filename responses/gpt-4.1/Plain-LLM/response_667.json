  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat role will future climate variability play in affecting the resilience of coastal energy infrastructure in Tunis, Tunisia in the coming decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFuture climate variability is likely to increase risks to the resilience of coastal energy infrastructure in Tunis due to sea-level rise, increased flooding, and more frequent extreme weather events.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate variability in the coming decades, including rising sea levels, higher temperatures, and greater storm intensity, is expected to heighten the vulnerability of coastal energy infrastructure in Tunis. Critical assets, such as power plants and substations near the coast, could face disruption from coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion. These risks threaten energy reliability and may increase maintenance and adaptation costs. Proactive resilience measures—including infrastructure upgrades and site planning—can help reduce potential damages and ensure energy security in the context of uncertain future climate conditions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Sea-level rise will increase flooding risk for Tunis’s coastal infrastructure. | Projected Mediterranean sea level rise of 0.3–0.6 m by 2100 increases flood risk for coastal cities, including Tunis. | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2021): https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/ | citation |\n| 2 | Extreme weather and heatwaves will affect energy asset reliability. | North African coastal cities face increased frequency of intense storms and heatwaves disrupting critical infrastructure. | World Bank, 2014: \"Turn Down the Heat: Confronting the New Climate Normal\" | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Uncertainty exists in emission scenarios and magnitude/timing of sea-level rise.  \n- Data limitations: Location-specific impact assessments for Tunis’s exact energy infrastructure are limited.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction of risk (more exposure), medium confidence in exact scale/timing.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Conduct local vulnerability assessments to identify risks to specific energy assets in coastal zones.  \n2. Invest in resilient infrastructure design, including flood protection and climate-adaptive maintenance plans.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Sea-level rise\" means the long-term increase in the average level of the sea, caused mainly by global warming.  \n- \"Resilience\" refers to the ability of infrastructure to withstand, adapt to, and recover from adverse climate events.",
