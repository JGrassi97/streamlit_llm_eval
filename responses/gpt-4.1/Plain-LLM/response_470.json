  "QuestionText": "How will projected changes in average monthly wind speeds affect the power output of offshore wind farms in the North Sea near Denmark by 2050?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will projected changes in average monthly wind speeds affect the power output of offshore wind farms in the North Sea near Denmark by 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nMost climate projections suggest only minor changes in average wind speeds, so offshore wind farm power output near Denmark is expected to remain largely stable through 2050.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nCurrent climate model projections for the North Sea region indicate that average monthly wind speeds are likely to change only slightly (typically ±2%) by 2050. Because wind power output is highly sensitive to wind speed, even small changes can have disproportionate effects, but the magnitude of projected changes is too small to cause significant reductions or increases in energy production. Main opportunities include planning for resilience to potential short-term variability, while the primary risks involve possible model uncertainties and the impacts of rare extreme weather events. Overall, offshore wind generation near Denmark is not expected to be strongly affected by projected wind speed changes by mid-century.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Projected changes in average wind speed in the North Sea by 2050 are ±2% or less | “The annual mean wind speed changes in the North Sea region are projected to be between -2% and +2%” | Tobin et al. (2016), Environmental Research Letters https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/034013 | citation |\n| 2 | Offshore wind power output will change little as a result of projected wind speed changes | “Overall, climate projections indicate that annual wind energy production will not significantly change in northern Europe by mid-century” | Pryor & Barthelmie (2010), Wind Energy https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/we.377 | citation |\n| 3 | Wind power output is proportional to the cube of wind speed, so small changes can matter, but projected changes are small | “The wind power production is strongly related to the cube of wind speed, however, projected changes are small enough to have limited impact” | Tobin et al. (2016) | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on RCP4.5/8.5 climate scenarios and ensemble model means; some local variation possible.  \n- Data limitations: Limited by available regional downscaling and uncertainty in future climate patterns.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction (little net change); moderate confidence in the exact magnitude due to model and scenario spread.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Continue to monitor updated regional climate projections and wind resource assessments for the North Sea area.  \n2. Prioritize adaptive infrastructure planning to accommodate potential increases in wind speed variability or rare extreme events.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “RCP4.5/8.5” are climate modeling scenarios representing different levels of future greenhouse gas emissions.  \n- “Cube of wind speed” means that wind power increases rapidly as wind speed rises, but only if wind speed changes are large.",
