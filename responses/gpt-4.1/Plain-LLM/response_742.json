  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nShifts in precipitation in Khartoum, Sudan through to 2030 could significantly impact the prevalence of waterborne diseases. Both increased rainfall and extended droughts can worsen risks: heavier rainfall may lead to flooding and contamination of water sources, while reduced rainfall can concentrate pollutants and make communities rely on unsafe water. These changes elevate the likelihood of diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and diarrheal illnesses in Khartoum, especially where sanitation infrastructure is weak.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly links shifts in precipitation patterns to changes in waterborne disease risks in Khartoum.  \n- Highlights why understanding climate impacts is crucial for health planning and water management in a vulnerable city.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Flooding from intense rainfall can increase waterborne disease outbreaks. | Past cholera outbreaks in Khartoum linked to flooding; WHO notes such events increase contamination. | World Health Organization, 2022 |\n| 2 | Reduced rainfall and drought can force reliance on unsafe or stagnant water, increasing disease risks. | Studies show water scarcity leads to use of untreated sources, raising waterborne infection rates. | UNEP, Sudan Post-Conflict Environmental Assessment, 2007 |\n| 3 | Projected climate change will likely make rainfall patterns more variable in Sudan by 2030. | Climate reports indicate increased precipitation variability for North East Africa, including Sudan. | Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2022 Report |\n| 4 | Weak urban water infrastructure in Khartoum makes the city more vulnerable to water contamination. | Assessment of Sudan’s urban water systems cites frequent contamination during floods and shortages. | WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, 2021 |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All sources referenced are peer-reviewed, official reports, or produced by recognized international expert organizations (e.g., WHO, UNEP, IPCC).  \n- No speculative or anecdotal evidence is used.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThere is some uncertainty regarding the precise magnitude and timing of future precipitation shifts in Khartoum, as climate models differ on the intensity and frequency of rainfall events. Disease risk projections depend on local infrastructure improvements, population growth, and government response, which are difficult to predict. However, the links between precipitation changes and waterborne disease risks are well-documented in the literature. Overall, the direction of risks—more variable rainfall increasing disease exposure—remains highly likely, but specific outbreak frequency or intensity cannot be precisely forecasted.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Strengthen and maintain water and sanitation infrastructure in Khartoum, focusing on flood defense and safe water access, to reduce contamination risks from both floods and droughts.\n2. Implement early warning systems and community education programs on water safety and hygiene, especially in areas prone to flooding or water scarcity.\n\n---",
