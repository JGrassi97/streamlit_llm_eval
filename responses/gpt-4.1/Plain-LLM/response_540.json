  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the anticipated public health consequences of climate change in the Bay of Bengal region over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures, extreme weather, sea-level rise, and ecosystem disruption are projected to increase infectious diseases, heat-related illnesses, malnutrition, and displacement-related health risks in the Bay of Bengal region.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next 30 years, climate change in the Bay of Bengal region is likely to exacerbate public health challenges. Key drivers include more frequent cyclones, flooding, sea-level rise, and shifting rainfall patterns, which together foster outbreaks of water-borne diseases (like cholera), vector-borne illnesses (like dengue), heat stress, respiratory ailments, and undernutrition due to impacts on agriculture and fisheries. Large-scale displacement from coastal erosion or extreme weather may further strain health and sanitation systems, elevating risks of disease transmission and mental health burdens. Opportunities exist to strengthen health systems, early warning infrastructure, and resilient public health planning to mitigate these risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Increased risk of water- and vector-borne diseases | Projected 5–20% increase in diarrheal disease risk and expanded dengue transmission area due to higher temperatures and flooding | WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia, \"Climate change and health in Bangladesh\" (2017) | citation |\n| 2 | Sea-level rise will drive coastal flooding and displacement | Up to 18 million people in Bangladesh face displacement by 2050 from rising sea levels | International Organization for Migration, \"Migration, Environment and Climate Change\" (2018) | citation |\n| 3 | Undernutrition is expected to worsen | Climate-driven crop yield declines in Bangladesh could increase childhood stunting rates | IPCC AR6, WGII, Chap 10: Asia | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Estimates assume continuation of current emissions and adaptation trajectories; impacts could vary by mitigation/adaptation success.  \n- Data limitations: Regional projections may not capture localized vulnerabilities or future adaptation interventions.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trends (increased disease, undernutrition, displacement); medium confidence in exact magnitude.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Strengthen climate-adaptive public health systems, including disease surveillance, early warning, and emergency response capacity.  \n2. Invest in resilient infrastructure (water, sanitation, health facilities) and targeted community education to reduce vulnerability.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Vector-borne diseases: illnesses spread by insects like mosquitoes (e.g., dengue, malaria).  \n- Undernutrition/stunting: poor nutrition leading to impaired growth in children.",
