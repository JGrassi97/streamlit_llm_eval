  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow do projected climate shifts alter the risk profile for investors in the global coffee market over the next 20 years, specifically at Latitude 4.8133, Longitude -75.756?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate shifts over the next 20 years are expected to increase production risks and volatility for investors in the global coffee market, particularly in regions near Latitude 4.8133, Longitude -75.756.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected climate shifts, including rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall, are likely to heighten risks for coffee investors by impacting crop yields, production reliability, and supply chains—especially in traditional producing regions such as Colombia. Reduced suitable land area, more frequent extreme weather events, and increased pest/disease outbreaks could result in greater yield variability and price volatility. This alters the risk profile, driving potential loss of returns, higher costs for adaptation, and a need for diversification or supply chain resilience strategies. However, adaptation initiatives and crop diversification may offer mitigation opportunities if managed proactively.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Colombia’s coffee-growing regions (including Quindío, near given coordinates) are projected to see declines in suitable coffee land due to higher temperatures and erratic rainfall over 20 years | FAO/CIAT, \"Climate change adaptation and mitigation in the Colombian coffee sector\" | FAO/CIAT (official report) | citation |\n| 2 | Climate-driven volatility and extreme weather can cause significant supply shocks, increasing price volatility and risk | ICO Market Report (referencing climate impacts on Arabica coffee price fluctuations) | International Coffee Organization | citation |\n| 3 | Investment in climate resilience and adaptation in coffee supply chains is increasingly necessary to manage future climate risks | World Bank \"Coffee and Climate Change: Impacts and Options for Adaptation in Brazil, Guatemala, Tanzania, Vietnam, and Yemen\" | World Bank (official report) | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections assume moderate climate change scenarios (e.g., IPCC RCP4.5–8.5); actual shifts depend on emissions, adaptation, and local practice.  \n- Data limitations: Regional and local climate projections have uncertainty; yield/price impacts may vary with ongoing research.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in general trend of risk increase; moderate confidence on precise location-specific magnitude.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Diversify sourcing and investment portfolios to include emerging suitable coffee regions and alternative crops.  \n2. Invest in climate adaptation strategies, such as funding for resilient coffee varieties, agroforestry, and farmer training in affected regions.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"RCP\" refers to \"Representative Concentration Pathways,\" which are scenarios used to model climate impacts based on greenhouse gas emissions.  \n- \"Yield variability\" means that the amount of coffee harvested can change unpredictably year to year due to changing weather.",
