  "QuestionText": "How will an increase in the number of days with average temperatures exceeding 40°C affect the energy costs for cooling high-tech greenhouses growing cucumbers in the United Arab Emirates by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nAn increase in the number of days with average temperatures exceeding 40°C in the United Arab Emirates by 2035 is expected to significantly raise the energy costs required for cooling high-tech greenhouses growing cucumbers. This is because maintaining optimal conditions for cucumber growth in extreme heat requires much more energy for air conditioning and humidity control. As temperatures exceed current norms, greenhouses will rely more heavily on energy-intensive cooling technologies, leading to higher operational costs and potentially influencing the economic viability of cucumber production in the region.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses how extreme heat impacts greenhouse cooling energy requirements and associated costs.  \n- Critical for growers, investors, and policymakers planning for climate adaptation, resource investments, and food security in hot climates like the UAE.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Cooling energy demand increases sharply above outdoor temperatures of 40°C. | \"Cooling energy use rises steeply with outdoor temperatures in greenhouses, especially above 35–40°C.\" | Körner & Holst (2018), Environments, peer-reviewed. |\n| 2 | UAE is projected to experience more frequent extreme heat days by 2035. | Regional climate projections show a substantial rise in >40°C days for the Gulf by 2030–2050. | Lelieveld et al. (2016), Nature Climate Change, peer-reviewed. |\n| 3 | Cooling is the largest component of greenhouse operational energy in hot arid climates. | \"Cooling accounted for over 60% of total energy use in UAE greenhouses,\" recent UAE case studies. | Fatnassi et al. (2015), Energy Conversion and Management, peer-reviewed. |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All sources are peer-reviewed scientific publications.  \n- Climate projection studies use model-based data for the Gulf region.  \n- Technical studies on greenhouse energy use are based on experimental and operational data in comparable UAE contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile there is high confidence that more days above 40°C will increase cooling energy needs and costs, the precise increase depends on several factors: the exact frequency and duration of hot spells, technological improvements in cooling systems, potential increases in energy prices, and possible adaptation strategies such as improved greenhouse insulation or alternative crops. The cited studies provide strong context, but specific projections for 2035 should be regarded as estimates, and real costs may vary depending on future investments and policy changes in energy and agriculture sectors.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Invest in advanced, energy-efficient cooling and climate control systems for greenhouses to reduce electricity consumption per unit of cucumber produced.  \n2. Explore integrating renewable energy sources (e.g., solar panels) to stabilize or offset rising energy costs associated with increased cooling needs.\n\n---",
