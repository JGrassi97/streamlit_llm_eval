  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nClimate variability is expected to have a significant impact on the profitability of the wine industry in key European regions like Bordeaux (France) and Tuscany (Italy, coordinates: 43.7696, 11.2558). In the coming decades, increased temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, and heightened risk of extreme events (like drought and hail) are likely to disrupt grape yields and alter wine quality. This may benefit certain grape varieties in the short term, but over time, it threatens both yield stability and product value, ultimately challenging profitability for producers in these regions.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses the effect of projected climate changes on vineyard productivity and wine quality in Bordeaux and Tuscany.  \n- The information is essential for wine producers, investors, and policymakers planning adaptive strategies in response to climate risk.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Higher temperatures are expected to affect grape ripening and could shift optimal grape varieties. | Peer-reviewed studies project earlier harvests and suitability for new grape varieties in Bordeaux and Tuscany by 2050. | Hannah et al., PNAS, 2013; van Leeuwen et al., OENO One, 2019 |\n| 2 | Increased climate variability (droughts, extreme weather) poses risks to yield and wine quality consistency. | Models indicate more frequent extreme heat, drought, and severe weather events impacting Western and Southern Europe. | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, 2021 |\n| 3 | Economic impacts may include reduced profitability and higher costs for adaptation (e.g., irrigation, canopy management). | Reports estimate higher climate adaptation costs for Southern European vineyards. | European Environment Agency, 2019 |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Main sources are peer-reviewed journal articles, reports from international scientific organizations (IPCC, EEA), and expert reviews. No speculative or unsupported claims are used.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nProjections of climate variability and its impacts include a degree of uncertainty due to limitations in climate models and regional variability. The exact effects on profitability will also depend on adaptation measures taken, changes in consumer preferences, and international competition. While the scientific consensus indicates clear long-term risks, local outcomes may vary, and there may be short-term benefits for certain grape varieties. The sources used are credible but acknowledge ranges of possible outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Invest in adaptation strategies such as shifting to heat-tolerant grape varieties, improving water management, and adopting vineyard technologies to buffer against extreme weather.\n2. Engage in regional and international collaborations for research, knowledge exchange, and securing financial support for climate resilience in the wine sector.\n\n---",
