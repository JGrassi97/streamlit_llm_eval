  "QuestionText": "What is the projected impact of warmer, drier summers on the risk of wildfires and subsequent closures of hiking trails in California's Sierra Nevada by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2035, warmer and drier summers in California’s Sierra Nevada are projected to significantly increase the risk of wildfires. This heightened wildfire activity is expected to cause more frequent and prolonged closures of hiking trails in the area around latitude 37.8651, longitude -119.5383 (including Yosemite and adjacent wilderness).  \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses the connection between climate conditions, wildfire risk, and trail accessibility for the specified Sierra Nevada location.  \n- Highlights the implications for recreational access, ecosystem resilience, and visitor safety planning.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Warmer, drier summers are projected for the Sierra Nevada by 2035. | Climate models forecast higher summer temperatures (+2-3°C) and reduced precipitation in the region. | Dettinger et al. (2018), California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment |\n| 2 | Increased wildfire risk is linked to these climatic changes. | Models show fire weather days and fuel dryness will significantly rise with warming. | Westerling et al. (2018), California Fourth Climate Change Assessment |\n| 3 | Wildfires are already causing hiking trail and park closures in the area. | Yosemite NP closed trails during 2020 and 2021 due to wildfire threats and smoke. | Yosemite National Park news releases, National Park Service |\n| 4 | Projections suggest these closures will become more frequent by 2035. | Management plans anticipate more fire-related disruptions as conditions worsen. | Sierra Nevada Conservancy, California State Parks reports |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Core sources are from California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment, a peer-reviewed and model-based review developed by academic and government agencies.\n- National Park Service publications provide direct reports on recent closures, considered authoritative.\n- Management agency documents support real-world planning and scenario development.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile scientific models and historical observations strongly indicate a rising wildfire risk with future warming and drying, the exact frequency, duration, and severity of future trail closures remain uncertain. This is due to variables such as year-to-year climate variability, the effectiveness of forest management practices, and possible improvements in fire response. Uncertainty also emerges from the limitations of regional climate and fire modeling at the fine scales relevant to specific trails and locations.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Trail managers and local authorities should develop adaptive closure protocols and improve public communication strategies to address the likely increase in wildfire-related disruptions by 2035.  \n2. Enhance vegetation management and fuel reduction efforts near recreation areas to help reduce the severity and spread of future wildfires.\n\n---",
