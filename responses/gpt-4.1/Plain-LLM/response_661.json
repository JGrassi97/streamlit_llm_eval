  "QuestionText": "What influence will projected temperature changes have on solar panel efficiency in the Sahara region, Algeria by 2050?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat influence will projected temperature changes have on solar panel efficiency in the Sahara region, Algeria by 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures by 2050 are projected to modestly reduce solar panel efficiency in the Sahara region, but high solar irradiance will still support significant energy yield.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2050, mean annual temperatures in the Sahara region of Algeria are expected to rise by 2–3°C due to climate change. Most standard crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) panels experience efficiency drops of about 0.4–0.5% per °C increased above 25°C, meaning the projected warming could cause a 0.8–1.5% reduction in absolute efficiency by 2050. Despite this modest loss, the region’s exceptionally high solar irradiance continues to make it one of the most favorable areas globally for solar power. Key risks include higher operating temperatures and accelerated panel aging, but mitigation through improved panel design or cooling is feasible.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Sahara temperatures expected to rise by 2–3°C by 2050 | \"Models project annual mean temperature increases of 2–3°C across North Africa in mid-century under RCP6.0\" | IPCC AR6 WG1, Ch. 12 (2021), Table 12.7 | citation |\n| 2 | PV efficiency loss per °C above 25°C averages 0.4–0.5% | \"For crystalline silicon PV modules, power output declines by 0.4–0.5% per °C above STC (25°C)\" | IEA PVPS T13-01:2014, p.19 | citation |\n| 3 | Projected efficiency reduction due to warming is ~0.8–1.5% | Calculation: (2–3°C) × 0.4–0.5%/°C = 0.8–1.5% | N/A | numeric |\n| 4 | High irradiance offsets some efficiency loss | “Sahara has among the highest global horizontal irradiance, supporting excellent PV yield despite high temperatures” | IEA World Energy Outlook 2020, Africa Special Report | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes RCP6.0-mid range emissions scenario and average PV temperature coefficient; higher warming or technology change could alter impact  \n- Data limitations: Lack of local microclimate datasets, and solar panel technology may improve by 2050  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in temperature projections; moderate confidence in estimated impact on PV efficiency\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize installation of PV modules with low temperature coefficients or advanced cooling/passive ventilation features.\n2. Monitor panel performance empirically and adapt project design as temperature trends are updated.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"PV\" stands for photovoltaic, a technology that converts sunlight into electricity.\n- \"Temperature coefficient\" describes the rate at which solar panel efficiency declines as temperature increases.",
