  "QuestionText": "How will future climate scenarios influence investment risk in the tourism sector of the Caribbean islands by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2035, future climate scenarios are expected to increase investment risk in the tourism sector of the Caribbean islands (such as around latitude 17.0608, longitude -61.7964, e.g., Antigua and Barbuda). Key risks include more frequent and intense hurricanes, sea level rise, coastal erosion, heatwaves, and coral reef bleachingâ€”all of which can damage infrastructure, reduce visitor numbers, and increase insurance and operational costs.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses tourism-related investment risks in the Caribbean, focusing on probable climate impacts by 2035.  \n- Provides practical insight for investors, policymakers, and tourism operators in evaluating future resilience and adaptation needs.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Projected increase in hurricane intensity and frequency | IPCC projects more intense tropical cyclones in the Caribbean by mid-century | IPCC AR6 WGII (2022), Chapter 15 |\n| 2 | Higher risk of coastal erosion and flooding | Studies indicate rising sea levels and increased coastal erosion affecting Caribbean tourism infrastructure | UNEP (2023), \"Climate change adaptation in the Caribbean tourism sector\" |\n| 3 | Heatwaves and coral bleaching likely to depress visitor numbers | Coral bleaching events have already impacted tourist attractions and revenue; further warming is expected to worsen this | World Bank (2017), \"Climate Change and Caribbean Tourism Sector\" |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Sources are predominantly peer-reviewed or from intergovernmental organizations regarded as authoritative (IPCC, UNEP, World Bank).\n- Evidence is based on a mix of observed impacts, predictive models, and sectoral assessments.\n- No unsupported or speculative claims included.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nUncertainty remains regarding the precise scale and timing of climate impacts by 2035, especially at the local or island-specific level. While model projections consistently indicate increased risks (e.g., stronger hurricanes, higher sea levels), variability exists in predicted frequency and severity. Differences in regional adaptation capacity, investment in resilient infrastructure, and global greenhouse gas emissions scenarios could alter risk levels. Observed trends already align with many projected impacts, increasing confidence in these scenarios, but exact outcomes remain unpredictable.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Prioritize investment in climate-resilient tourism infrastructure (e.g., elevated, reinforced structures, improved drainage, natural buffers).\n2. Update risk assessments and insurance schemes to incorporate latest climate projections for the region.\n\n---",
