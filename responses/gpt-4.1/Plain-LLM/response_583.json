  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2035, climate change is expected to significantly elevate investment risks in the tourism sector of the Caribbean islands near latitude 17.0608, longitude -61.7964 (Antigua and Barbuda region). Anticipated changes such as increased hurricane frequency and intensity, sea level rise, coastal erosion, and heatwaves will threaten tourism infrastructure, degrade natural attractions, and disrupt travel patterns. This will likely raise insurance costs, reduce investor confidence, and require greater capital outlays for climate adaptation.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Direct answer covers links between forecasted climate impacts and investment risk for tourism in the specified region.\n- This matters for investors, policymakers, and local businesses deciding whether—and how—to invest in tourism under climate uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Increased hurricane activity elevates infrastructure risk | 2021 IPCC report shows projected increase in intensity of Atlantic hurricanes affecting Caribbean | IPCC AR6, 2021 |\n| 2 | Sea level rise and beach erosion threaten coastal resorts | Caribbean Tourism Organization notes coastal erosion is undermining hotel infrastructure | Caribbean Tourism Organization, 2020 |\n| 3 | Climate risks will drive up operating and insurance costs for tourism businesses | World Bank briefs highlight growing insurance and adaptation costs for Caribbean tourism | World Bank, 2021 |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All cited sources are either peer-reviewed (IPCC), expert-reviewed, or published by reputable international organizations (World Bank, CTO). No speculation included.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile climate models consistently project increasing risks for the Caribbean tourism sector, precise impacts by 2035 remain uncertain due to variable rates of warming, storm activity, and adaptation measures taken by local stakeholders. Uncertainty is compounded by limitations in regional-scale projections and the potential for unanticipated economic or policy developments. Stakeholder adaptation, the pace of global emissions reductions, and regional preparedness all influence the degree of future investment risk.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Conduct a detailed, location-specific climate risk assessment to inform future tourism investment decisions and infrastructure planning.  \n2. Invest in resilient infrastructure and ecosystem protection (e.g., restoring mangroves, elevating buildings) to reduce vulnerability to extreme weather and sea-level rise.\n\n---",
