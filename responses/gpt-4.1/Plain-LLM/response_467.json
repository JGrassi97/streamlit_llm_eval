  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the forecasts for the viability of renewable energy infrastructure in coastal regions of Australia given climate projections for 2040-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRenewable energy infrastructure in coastal Australia is expected to remain viable through 2040-2050, but climate risks—especially from sea level rise and extreme weather—will require adaptive measures.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nCoastal regions of Australia, such as near Sydney (approx. -33.87, 151.21), remain promising for renewable energy deployment (wind, solar, rooftop PV, offshore wind) to 2050 due to robust resource conditions and policy support. However, climate projections indicate increased threats from sea level rise, storms, and heatwaves, which may impact infrastructure resilience. Key opportunities include strong wind and solar resources, while risks relate to flooding, saltwater corrosion, and grid disruptions. Proactive siting, design adaptations, and protective investments will be vital to maintain long-term viability in the face of escalating climate impacts.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Sea level rise and extreme weather pose increasing risks to coastal energy infrastructure | CSIRO projects 0.2–0.3 m sea level rise by 2050 for Australia’s coast | CSIRO State of the Climate 2022, Section 4 | citation |\n| 2 | Australia’s coastal wind and solar resources remain strong and suitable for continued renewable investment | High average annual solar exposure and wind speeds; government targets for renewables >80% by 2030 | Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) Integrated System Plan 2022; Geoscience Australia | citation |\n| 3 | Infrastructure can be resilient if designed for projected climate impacts | Infrastructure Australia highlights adaptation measures (elevated platforms, corrosion resistance, setback from erosion zones) | Infrastructure Australia—Resilience of energy infrastructure report 2021 | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Uses CSIRO RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate projections for mid-century; site-specific impacts may vary  \n- Data limitations: Limited availability of local, project-level vulnerability assessments  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in increasing climate risks; medium confidence in local adaptive capacity outcomes\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Plan and site new infrastructure above projected sea level/flood zones with climate-adapted designs.\n2. Retrofit existing assets with enhanced corrosion protection and storm resilience measures.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Sea level rise: The gradual increase in ocean height caused by thermal expansion and melting ice, threatening low-lying infrastructure.\n- Corrosion resistance: Using materials or coatings that prevent rust or decay from exposure to salty, humid coastal air.",
