  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the expected financial risks to supply chains originating from manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia due to climate change? (Location: Latitude 13.7563, Longitude 100.5018)\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change poses significant financial risks to Southeast Asian supply chains through increased disruption from extreme weather, flooding, and production losses.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nSupply chains based in Southeast Asia, including around 13.7563°N, 100.5018°E (Bangkok region), face material financial risks from climate change. Increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather—especially flooding, storms, and heatwaves—can disrupt production, damage assets, increase insurance and logistics costs, and lengthen lead times. Low-lying regions are especially vulnerable to flooding, while water stress and heat can create operational downtime and productivity loss. The financial impact is magnified by high regional exposure to global electronics, apparel, and automotive supply chains. Direct costs include asset damage and production losses; indirect costs include supply disruption, increased inventory, and higher insurance premiums.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Flooding poses major business disruption risk in Bangkok and Southeast Asian hubs. | Bangkok’s 2011 flood caused >US$45 billion in losses, with supply chain impacts on automotive and electronics sectors globally. | “Economic Impacts of the 2011 Floods in Thailand” (World Bank) | Numeric |\n| 2 | Climate change is projected to increase frequency and severity of extreme weather events in Southeast Asia. | “SEA has experienced increased frequency of heavy rainfall and flooding events, and projections indicate an upward trend.” | IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Regional Fact Sheet – Asia | Citation |\n| 3 | Insurance and logistics costs have risen following major climate events. | “Global supply chains faced increased costs, insurance claims, and rerouting expenses following 2011 flooding.” | Marsh Risk Consulting analysis (as cited in World Bank) | Citation |\n| 4 | Coastal manufacturing hubs are at heighted risk from sea-level rise. | “Many manufacturing zones in Bangkok and the Mekong Delta are within flood-prone zones.” | UNDRR, ASEAN Disaster Risk Assessment 2020 | Text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Impacts depend on future emissions and regional adaptation measures; models project increased frequency of severe flooding and storms.\n- Data limitations: Most evidence relies on historical events (not future financial projections); localized future data limited.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in increased risk/disruption trends; lower confidence in sector-specific financial quantification.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Map specific supply chain assets and critical nodes to high-risk flood/heat zones for targeted resilience planning.\n2. Evaluate and adapt supplier diversification, inventory buffers, and alternative logistics to reduce disruption and financial exposure.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Extreme weather” includes unusually severe floods, storms, and heatwaves.\n- “Lead times” refers to the time between order placement and delivery—these can increase if supply is disrupted.\n\n",
