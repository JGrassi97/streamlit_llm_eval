  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nThe long-term sustainability prospects for the ski tourism industry in the European Alps, specifically near latitude 47.2692 and longitude 10.5976 (close to Oberstdorf, Germany/Austria border), are increasingly challenging due to projected climate change impacts by 2040-2050. Rising temperatures are expected to shorten natural snow seasons, reduce snow reliability, and increase operating costs, making traditional ski tourism less viable, especially at lower altitudes.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses the viability of ski tourism at the geographic location in question, considering future climate scenarios.\n- This information matters for local governments, ski operators, and tourism-dependent communities planning adaptation or diversification strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Significant reduction in natural snow reliability below 1500m by 2050 | IPCC AR6 Report: Physical Science Basis (2021), climate models project 50-70% reduction in snow cover at these altitudes | IPCC, 2021 |\n| 2 | Adaptation measures like snowmaking become less effective and more costly as temperatures rise | Peer-reviewed review of ski area adaptation in the Alps (Steiger & Scott, 2020) | Current Issues in Tourism, 2020 |\n| 3 | Alpine ski tourism faces declining long-term economic sustainability, especially for smaller, low-altitude resorts | European Environment Agency report: “Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2016” | EEA, 2016 |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The main sources are peer-reviewed scientific reviews, credible international assessments (e.g., IPCC, EEA), and model-based projections specific to the European Alps.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe outlook is based on well-established climate models and historical trends, but specific local impacts can vary due to microclimates and possible technological or policy interventions. While general warming trends are robustly projected, local adaptation capacity and future snow-management technologies introduce uncertainties. Economic impacts will also depend on tourist behavior, potential for diversification, and investment in alternatives.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Begin diversifying tourism offerings to include year-round, non-snow-dependent activities (e.g., hiking, cycling, wellness tourism) to reduce reliance on winter sports.\n2. Assess the financial and environmental cost of continued snowmaking, and explore long-term feasibility studies for adaptation versus transformation to other forms of tourism.\n\n---",
