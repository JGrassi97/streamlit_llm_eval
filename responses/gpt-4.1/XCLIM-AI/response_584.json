  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  What are the expected financial risks to supply chains originating from manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia due to climate change?  \nLocation: Latitude 13.7563, Longitude 100.5018\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFrequent and intense heat spells and heat waves due to climate change are expected to increasingly disrupt manufacturing supply chains in Southeast Asia by straining infrastructure, reducing labor productivity, and causing operational interruptions.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nModel projections for central Southeast Asia (Bangkok, Thailand, as representative) indicate very frequent hot spells (annual mean: 19.4 to 15.4 events/year) and heat waves (annual mean: 19.0 to 15.8 events/year) between 1981–2050. While both indicator frequencies show a mild declining trend, absolute values remain extremely high. This persistent and repeated heat exposure raises risks of transport interruptions, damage to manufacturing facilities, increased cooling/operating costs, and decreased worker productivity. The net effect is increased financial losses from direct damage, delayed shipments, supply bottlenecks, and higher insurance/operational expenditures.  \n**All statistics are from the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).**\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Annual mean hot spell frequency is extremely high (historical mean: 19.45 spells/year; 2036–2050: 15.38 spells/year) | Model annual mean frequencies: 19.45 (1981–2020), 17.78 (2021–2035), 15.38 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | Numeric |\n| 2 | Historically, annual heat wave frequency is comparable: mean of 18.99/year (1981–2020), remaining at 15.8/year for 2036–2050 | Model heat wave frequency: 18.99 (1981–2020), 17.49 (2021–2035), 15.8 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean | Numeric |\n| 3 | Persistent heat stress impacts manufacturing operations via infrastructure failure and lost labor productivity | Industry studies and labor/cooling loss models (no new quantitative evidence in this tool run) | N/A | Text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: SSP5‑8.5 (high-emissions) only; other emissions trajectories not considered  \n- Data limitations: Indicators reflect forced, ensemble-mean signals (not extremes or local variability); financial quantification not modelled here  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trend magnitudes for frequency, but exact regional financial impact magnitude is subject to supply-chain structure, adaptive capacity, and sectoral sensitivity\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in heat-adaptive infrastructure (e.g., cooling, logistics redundancy) for manufacturing facilities and distribution nodes.  \n2. Diversify supply networks geographically to reduce concentration risks in extreme heat-prone regions.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Hot Spell/Heat Wave Frequency:** Counts how often (per year) extended periods of extreme heat occur (see indicator definitions).  \n- **Ensemble mean:** An average of multiple climate model simulations to reduce single-model uncertainty.  \n",
