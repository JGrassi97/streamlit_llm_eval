  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might future temperature conditions influence the stability of financial markets in Nouakchott, Mauritania over the coming decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nA sustained increase in tropical nights—projected to reach over 275 nights per year by 2050—poses significant systemic risks to economic stability in Nouakchott through its effects on energy demand, workforce productivity, and social infrastructure.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected climate trends for Nouakchott indicate a marked increase in the number of tropical nights (minimum temperature >20°C), with ensemble means rising from 233 nights/year (1981–2020) to 277 nights/year (2036–2050). This persistent nocturnal heat will increase operational costs (notably air conditioning), erode labor productivity, disrupt supply chains, and amplify energy and health sector volatility—key factors linked to market instability. These effects heighten credit, operational, and market risks for financial institutions, particularly in sectors sensitive to heatwaves and energy prices. Adaptive investment strategies, infrastructure upgrades, and regulatory stress-testing frameworks are advised to mitigate temperature-induced vulnerabilities.  \nAll quantitative results sourced from the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Number of tropical nights rising sharply | Mean: 233 nights/year (1981–2020), 256 (2021–35), and 277 (2036–50); trend: +0.7 to +1.7 nights/year | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Acceleration of trend in nocturnal heat extremes | Slope increases from +0.71 (historical) to +1.74 tropical nights/year (2021–35, p < 0.01) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble | numeric |\n| 3 | Increased energy demand and market volatility risks | Persistent tropical nights drive energy and operational costs; impacts supported by peer-reviewed attribution studies | N/A | citation/text |\n| 4 | Latitude Temperature Index (LTI) unavailable | LTI computation failed due to dataset input limitation | N/A | N/A |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on SSP5-8.5 high-emission scenario; ensemble mean smooths internal variability but may under-represent extremes  \n- Data limitations: LTI indicator unavailable due to technical constraint; local adaptation or microclimate effects are not incorporated  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trend direction; moderate confidence in direct quantitative financial impact attribution  \n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Integrate climate scenario stress tests (with emphasis on nocturnal heat risk) in market stability and sectoral risk assessments.\n2. Prioritize investments in resilient energy infrastructure, urban cooling strategies, and health-related safeguards to mitigate financial vulnerability.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Tropical nights” are nights where minimum temperatures remain above 20°C; sustained occurrence strains cooling systems, health, and productivity.\n- SSP5-8.5 is a climate model scenario assuming continued high global greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n",
