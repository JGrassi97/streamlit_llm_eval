  "QuestionText": "What effects are anticipated from changes in precipitation on water infrastructure in Khartoum, Sudan by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat effects are anticipated from changes in precipitation on water infrastructure in Khartoum, Sudan by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nNo statistically significant change in annual or monthly liquid precipitation is projected for Khartoum by 2040, implying minimal direct risk or opportunity for water infrastructure from precipitation changes alone.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBased on the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, SSP5-8.5 scenario), both historical (1981–2020) and projected (2036–2050) annual and monthly liquid precipitation values for Khartoum are effectively zero, with no discernible trend or change through 2040. This suggests that direct increases or decreases in rainfall will not be a primary driver of water infrastructure impact in this period. However, projections show a gradual increase in atmospheric moisture deficit (VPD), which may exacerbate water scarcity and increase pressure on existing infrastructure indirectly via enhanced evaporation, even without a change in rainfall.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Liquid precipitation is projected to remain at 0 mm/year/month through 2050 | All historical (1981–2020), short-term (2021–2035), and medium-term (2036–2050) means for rain_approximation: mean = 0.0, std = 0.0, min = 0.0, max = 0.0 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | No statistically significant trend in rainfall is indicated | Rainfall trend slopes = 0.0, p-values >0.05 throughout all time slices | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble | numeric |\n| 3 | Average annual vapour pressure deficit (VPD) increases from 3072 Pa (historical) to 3294 Pa (2036–2050); standard deviation rises as well | VPD mean: historical 3072 Pa, 2021–2035: 3168 Pa, 2036–2050: 3294 Pa; positive trends, though with variability (trend slope up to +14 Pa/year) | CMIP6 HighResMIP | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes continuity of high-emission SSP5-8.5 pathway; only ensemble mean considered; local convective precipitation extremes may not be captured in mean values.  \n- Data limitations: Ensemble mean may under-represent rare but high-intensity rainfall events critical for infrastructure. No direct observation-based validation for Khartoum.  \n- Confidence statements: Confidence is high in absence of mean precipitation trend, but lower for extremes not reflected in ensemble means.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize infrastructure maintenance for existing water scarcity, focusing on network leakage reduction and water-efficient technology.  \n2. Develop integrated drought contingency plans that anticipate greater evaporative losses driven by rising VPD, despite unchanged rainfall means.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD): Measures how much moisture the air can “hold” before condensation; higher values mean drier air, more evaporation, and greater stress on water supplies.  \n- Ensemble mean: An average across several climate models, reducing noise but potentially missing rare extremes (such as flash floods).",
