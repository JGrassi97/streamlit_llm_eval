  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat implications do rising temperatures have on risk assessments for the agricultural insurance sector in Fez, Morocco by 2040?\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2040, a sharp increase in extreme heat days in Fez will substantially elevate agricultural risk—necessitating adaptation and higher premiums in insurance sector risk assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nModel projections indicate a pronounced rise in the number of days where both minimum and maximum temperatures exceed critical thresholds (22°C and 30°C) in Fez, with the annual mean rising from ~24 days (historical) to ~46 days (2036–2050). This escalation in extreme heat events heightens the risk of crop stress and yield loss, directly impacting insurance risk profiles. No significant change is projected in the instantaneous rainfall fraction, so primary physical risk arises from chronic heat stress rather than immediate rainfall variability. The insurance sector in Fez should anticipate more frequent claims, higher indemnity payments, and should incentivize resilience measures.  \n*Source: CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).*\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type |\n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Days with daily min >22°C and max >30°C almost double by 2040 | Historical (1981-2020) mean: 24.26 days; 2036–2050 mean: 46.18 days; trend +1.05 days/year (p=0.038) | CMIP6 HighResMIP (see tool output) | numeric |\n| 2 | No change in rainfall as fraction of total precip on hot days | Rainfall approximation = 0.0 for all periods analyzed | CMIP6 HighResMIP (see tool output) | numeric |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: SSP5-8.5 high emissions; multi-model mean used to reduce individual model uncertainty  \n- Data limitations: Analysis did not include sub-seasonal rainfall intensity, extreme precipitation, or localized microclimates; results aggregate over Fez grid cell  \n- Confidence statements: High for temperature trend (p=0.038); very high confidence in strong upwards trend; medium for sectoral risk translation due to cropping system variability\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Adjust premium models and underwriting to reflect increased probability of heat-induced crop failure/events.\n2. Promote or require heat-resilient crop varieties, drought/heat insurance riders, and on-farm monitoring to reduce claims volatility.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Threshold” here means the temperature value above which extreme heat is defined for risk calculations.\n- Multi-model “ensemble mean” averages projections from several climate models to obtain a more robust result.\n\n",
