  "QuestionText": "How will future climate conditions alter the market risks for globally traded commodities like coffee and cocoa?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n### Executive summary\n\nFuture climate conditions at the specified location (near Medellín, Colombia: Lat 6.25, Lon -75.57) indicate a moderate increase in both the variability of daily temperature ranges and the minimum of average daily temperatures through 2050. For globally traded commodities like coffee and cocoa—both highly sensitive to climate—this implies increased production risks. More variable and generally warmer temperatures could result in greater stress on crops, elevated risk of yield losses, and possibly reduced quality; all of which may translate into increased market risks including supply shocks and volatility in global commodity prices.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The minimum average daily temperature is expected to rise, and intra-annual temperature variability will slightly increase. Both are critical factors affecting coffee and cocoa crop suitability and resilience.\n- These changes influence not just yields but also the quality and geographical suitability for cultivation, with direct consequences for supply chains and market stability.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim                                                                                          | Evidence                                                                                                         | Source                                                                |\n|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Minimum mean daily temperatures will increase by ~0.87°C between 1981–2050                     | Historical mean: 288.35K; medium-term (2036-2050) mean: 289.22K                                                  | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Variability in daily temperature range will modestly increase by ~0.09 K                        | Historical mean: 2.27 K; medium-term (2036-2050): 2.36 K                                                         | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | Increased temperature and variability are key drivers of crop health and output variability     | Peer-reviewed assessments (e.g. IPCC AR6, research on climate & coffee/cocoa productivity)                        | See IPCC AR6; secondary literature*                                   |\n| 4 | Data are derived from a multi-model, high-resolution climate ensemble, reducing model bias      | Multi-model ensemble, explicit documentation of CMIP6 HighResMIP methodology                                      | CMIP6 protocol & data documentation                                    |\n\n*Specific peer-reviewed crop response evidence is not provided in this output, but is well-established in the literature.  \n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Temperature projections use the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean, considered a high-standard, peer-reviewed, model-based climate dataset.\n- The link between temperature/variability and commodity risk is supported by numerous expert-reviewed articles and the IPCC.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nWhile high-resolution, multi-model data (CMIP6 HighResMIP) substantially reduces uncertainties related to model structural bias and internal climate variability, there remains uncertainty in crop/system response to these changes. Factors such as adaptation among local farmers, potential for crop migration, technological changes, and unforeseen weather extremes are not captured in the temperature statistics alone. The projections cited (especially statistical means) are robust, but specific impacts on market risks involve additional socio-economic variables not modeled here.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Coffee and cocoa sector participants (producers/exporters, traders, policy-makers) should proactively invest in climate adaptation: such as breeding climate-resilient varieties, shifting to altitude-adapted cultivation, and developing crop insurance schemes.\n2. Supply chain actors should monitor ongoing climate trends and incorporate scenario-based risk management, including hedging, diversified sourcing, and ensuring traceability to climate-resilient production zones.\n\n---",
