  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  How might climate change affect the valuation of long-term infrastructure investments in coastal Australian cities like Sydney by 2040?.\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2040, increased heat wave durations are projected to raise risks to long-term infrastructure in Sydney, while precipitation intensity remains relatively stable, supporting slightly improved or maintained valuations for resilient, well-adapted assets.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate projections for coastal Sydney indicate a marked rise in cumulative heat wave duration by 2040 under a high-emissions pathway, from a historical mean of 0.48 days/year to 1.8 days/year (2036–2050), increasing risks for infrastructure through enhanced heat stress, materials degradation, and peak energy demands. The Simple Daily Intensity Index (SDII)—a measure of average precipitation on wet days—shows no significant upward trend. Thus, while flood risks from precipitation extremes remain stable, asset values for infrastructure exposed to thermal extremes will increasingly depend on adaptation investment. Overall, the growing frequency and duration of heat waves will be the most significant climate-driven factor for asset performance and valuation by 2040.  \n(Source: CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5).\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type |\n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heat wave total length increases substantially by 2040 | Mean rises from 0.48 ± 0.54 days/year (1981–2020) to 1.8 ± 1.2 days/year (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5 | numeric |\n| 2 | Precipitation intensity (SDII) remains stable | Mean of 9.71 ± 0.72 mm/d (historical) vs. 9.72 ± 0.65 mm/d (2036–2050), trend slope ≈ 0 | CMIP6 HighResMIP hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5 | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis uses SSP5-8.5 (high emissions), multi-model mean; actual emissions/pathways could diverge.\n- Data limitations: Only two indicators (heat wave total length, SDII); does not account for local sea level rise, wind, or compound events.\n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence for increased heat event risk; high confidence in stable SDII; uncertainty remains on other hazards.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize infrastructure investment in heat-resilient materials and cooling/adaptation strategies for public assets.\n2. Maintain robust precipitation and flood management, but reweight risk modeling toward future extreme temperature stress.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Heat wave total length\" = total days per year that meet defined extreme-heat event thresholds.\n- \"Simple Daily Intensity Index (SDII)\" = avg. rainfall on wet days, indicating precipitation intensity.\n",
