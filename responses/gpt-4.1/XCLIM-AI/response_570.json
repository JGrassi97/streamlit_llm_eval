  "QuestionText": "How will a reduction in the number of months with average temperatures below freezing affect the viability of the ski industry in the Pyrenees near Andorra by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n### Executive summary\n\nBy 2040, the number of months with average minimum temperatures below freezing in the Pyrenees near Andorra is projected to decrease. Historically, the frost season (period with sustained minimum temperatures below 0 °C) averaged about 71 days per year (1981–2020), but is expected to decline to ~49 days by 2036–2050. This significant reduction, coupled with a later onset of the first sub-freezing night (increasing from an average day-of-year ~304 to ~310), indicates a markedly shorter and less reliable natural snow season before 2040.  \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- A shorter frost season means fewer reliable weeks of natural snow, affecting ski resort viability.\n- The ski season may start later and end earlier, limiting the window for profitable operations and increasing the risk of snow droughts or dependence on artificial snow.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | The frost season length will decrease from ~71 to ~49 days per year by mid-century near Andorra | Frost season length: mean drops from 71.04 (1981–2020) to 49.0 (2036–2050) with a negative trend | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | First sub-freezing minimum temperature occurs later in the year (from ~304th day to ~310th day) | First day of minimum temperature < 0 °C: shifts from day 304.07 (1981–2020) to 310.37 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | Decreasing frost season days directly reduces the potential ski season length and natural snow cover | See above data—shorter duration of sub-freezing conditions limits snow | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All evidence comes from peer-reviewed, multi-model ensemble simulations (CMIP6 HighResMIP), providing robust, model-based projections using high spatial and temporal resolution specifically designed for climate impact analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile multi-model ensemble projections are generally reliable and suppress internal variability, uncertainties remain due to interannual weather fluctuations, model differences in local microclimate representation, and factors not captured in temperature-based indices, such as future snowmaking capacity, precipitation form, and resort adaptation strategies. Nevertheless, the consistent signal of a shorter and delayed frost season across all ensemble members indicates medium to high confidence in a marked reduction in natural snow reliability.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Ski resorts should pivot towards diversification of winter and year-round tourism offerings, reducing reliance on natural snow.\n2. Invest in adaptive infrastructure (e.g., enhanced artificial snowmaking), but with a critical view of future water and energy availability, as the physical limits to snow production will tighten as freezing periods decline.\n\n---",
