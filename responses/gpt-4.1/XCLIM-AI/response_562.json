  "QuestionText": "How might climate change impact the viability and seasonality of tourism in the Caribbean by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2040, rising temperatures in the Caribbean are expected to significantly disrupt the viability and seasonality of tourism. The region will experience an increasing number of hot days and warm nights (tropical nights), reducing the length of comfortable tourist seasons and intensifying heat stress for visitors and local communities. The trends point toward hotter conditions encroaching into what are currently considered high-tourist seasons, potentially reducing demand during traditionally popular months and shifting tourism activity toward cooler periods—if such periods remain available.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The number of tropical nights (nights where minimum temperature stays above 20°C) is projected to increase markedly, reaching a near year-round occurrence by 2040.\n- Tourism viability is directly challenged, as fewer comfortable days may lead to reduced visitor numbers and a need to adapt service offerings or shift seasonality.\n- This information is crucial for tourism operators, infrastructure planners, and policymakers in the Caribbean seeking to maintain economic resiliency.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Tropical nights will become nearly year-round by 2040. | Mean tropical nights: historical 303 days/year; 2021-2035 ~339 days; 2036-2050 ~354 days. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | The frequency and persistence of hot nights and days will shorten the traditional high season for tourism, as heat stress increases. | Slope in tropical nights: +2.47 days/year (2021-2035), plateauing by 2040. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | Intensified and prolonged heat may discourage visits and impact comfort, safety, and attractiveness for key tourism activities. | High and increasing mean; more than 95% of nights above 20°C by mid-century. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Data are based on a peer-reviewed, multi-model ensemble: CMIP6 HighResMIP, which is widely used in climate risk assessments.\n- Results are model-based, using the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario, and represent the ensemble mean (reducing uncertainty compared to single models).\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile projections from the CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble are robust and widely used, some uncertainty remains regarding the exact pace of warming and local climate variability. This ensemble mean approach smooths out individual model variability but cannot fully capture local climate effects (e.g., microclimates, sea breezes, or rare cooling episodes). The SSP5-8.5 scenario represents a high-emission pathway, and actual warming may be somewhat less if strong mitigation policies are implemented. Nevertheless, the magnitude and consistency of the projected trends suggest high confidence that heat stress will intensify and the seasonality of comfortable tourism weather will diminish.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Re-evaluate peak and off-peak tourism seasons; consider shifting marketing and services toward months or locations least affected by heat, and expanding offerings to adapt to warmer conditions (e.g., providing cooling infrastructure, shade, or heat-safety advisories).\n2. Develop climate-resilient tourism infrastructure (cooling systems, landscape design for shade) and monitor evolving climate trends annually to adapt strategies proactively.\n\n---",
