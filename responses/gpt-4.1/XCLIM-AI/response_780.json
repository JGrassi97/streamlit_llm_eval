  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  How might projected climate changes alter insurance risk assessments in Rabat, Morocco over the next three decades? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected climate changes in Rabat, Morocco are not expected to increase risks from days with both heavy precipitation and cold temperature, or from freeze-thaw spells, based on ensemble mean projections for the next three decades.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of CMIP6 HighResMIP model ensemble data for Rabat (1950–2050) indicates that the frequency of days with both high precipitation (>0.4 mm/day) and low temperatures (<-0.2°C), as well as freeze-thaw spell events, has historically been and will remain negligible through 2050. This suggests minimal direct increase in climate-driven insurance risks attributable to these specific hazards over the next thirty years. These findings apply to the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario. However, risks related to other climate perils (e.g., heat waves, droughts) are not addressed in this analysis.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | No days with both high precipitation (>0.4 mm/d) and cold temperature (<-0.2°C) are projected historically or for 2021–2050 | 0.0 days per year (historical mean 1981-2020 = 0.0, 2021–2035 = 0.0, 2036–2050 = 0.0) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Freeze-thaw spells (spells of at least 1 day with daily max >0°C, min ≤0°C) are not projected for the historical or future period | Historical mean (1981–2020): 0.0; 2021–2035: 0.0; 2036–2050: 0.0 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: High-emission scenario SSP5-8.5 only; results are ensemble means (internal variability suppressed)  \n- Data limitations: Other relevant perils (e.g., extreme heat, drought, wind) not analyzed here; local extremes may be underestimated  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence for negligible risk from analyzed hazards under ensemble mean projection\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Insurance portfolios in Rabat should not expect increased payouts from compounded cold and wet weather risks or freeze-thaw damage through 2050, based on current high-resolution model evidence.\n2. Broaden risk assessments to include other hazards (e.g., heat waves, drought, flood from non-cold-season storms) for a more comprehensive climate impact appraisal.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Freeze-thaw spell\": Consecutive days where daily max temperature is above 0°C and daily min is at or below 0°C, which can affect infrastructure.\n- \"Ensemble mean\": The average output from several climate models, providing a robust estimate of forced climate signals rather than rare local events.\n\n",
