  "QuestionText": "How might projected climate changes alter insurance risk assessments in Rabat, Morocco over the next three decades?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nProjected climate changes in Rabat, Morocco over the next three decades are expected to substantially increase the number of days with both high minimum and maximum temperatures (i.e., simultaneous nighttime and daytime heat). Specifically, days exceeding minimum temperatures of 22 °C and maximums above 30 °C are forecast to rise from 12.3 days/year (historical, 1981–2020) to 19.5 days/year (2021–2035) and 24.6 days/year (2036–2050). There is no projected change in liquid rainfall occurrence as classified using temperature-based phase separation. This heightens risks primarily related to heat—including health, infrastructure, crop exposure, and potentially energy demand—while rainfall-driven flood risk does not show evidence of change based on this indicator.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The marked rise in extreme heat days signals increased exposure for health, property, and crop risks, directly informing insurance assessments.\n- No evidence of rainfall regime change via this method highlights heat risks as the primary driver for updated risk portfolios in the near future.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim                                                                             | Evidence                                                                | Source                                                                      |\n|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Heat extremes (days above 22 °C min and 30 °C max) will increase significantly     | Projected rise from 12.3 to 24.6 annual days, 1981–2050                 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950 / highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | No projected change in frequency of days recognized as liquid rainfall by this criterion | Rainfall approximation shows 0 days per year in all periods             | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950 / highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 3 | Projected trends are calculated using ensemble mean (multi-model average)          | Results minimize variability from internal climate fluctuations          | CMIP6 HighResMIP documentation; model-based, peer-reviewed                  |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All results are from peer-reviewed, global climate model ensemble projections (CMIP6 HighResMIP, seven-model mean), using standardized, documented definitions and scenario protocols.\n- The scenario used (SSP5-8.5) reflects a high-emissions, high-forcing pathway.\n- No single-model results; ensemble averaging improves signal detection but may mask regional extremes.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nThe projections are based on ensemble mean outputs from CMIP6 HighResMIP, which represents forced climate signals and minimizes internal variability. Uncertainty remains regarding the exact magnitude and inter-annual variability of extreme temperature days, as local extremes and short-term fluctuations may not be fully resolved at the ~50 km model resolution. The high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5) used provides a \"worst case\" policy-relevant envelope, but future emissions and adaptation measures could lead to different outcomes. Rainfall phase classification (liquid vs. solid) by a temperature threshold provides only a binary separation, and does not account for changes in total precipitation amount or intensity, which might still drive flood or drought risk. These limitations mean actual insurance risk may be underestimated if rainfall extremes or local heatwaves occur outside the multi-model consensus.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Insurance risk models should be updated to explicitly account for a doubling of concurrent heatwave days (min >22°C and max >30°C) over the next three decades in Rabat, with particular emphasis on heatwave-driven impacts to health, infrastructure, and business interruption.\n2. Complement these results with additional local studies of extreme precipitation and compound events, as rainfall approximation here shows no signal change, but this does not exclude changes in intensity or temporal clustering that can drive local flood risks.\n\n---",
