  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  What are the systemic financial risks that climate change poses to the agricultural lending portfolios of banks in the US Midwest?. \n\nDo not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change poses moderate but persistent financial risks to Midwest agricultural lending portfolios by altering rainfall patterns and intensities, potentially affecting crop yields and borrower credit risk.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAgricultural lending in the US Midwest faces systemic financial risk from climate-driven changes in rainfall intensity and patterns, as indicated by model simulations under SSP5-8.5. Rainfall approximation data show no statistically significant trend in total annual liquid precipitation at the representative Iowa location (Des Moines, 41.59°N, -93.62°W) between 1981–2050, but the Simple Daily Intensity Index (SDII) for wet days is projected to rise marginally from a mean of 10.92 mm/d (1981–2020) to 11.29 mm/d (2036–2050). This increase in daily rainfall intensity implies heightened flood, runoff, and yield variability risk, even as average totals remain stationary. Such shifts threaten loan performance, require adjustments in risk models, and may affect collateral values and insurance claims.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | No significant trend in total annual liquid precipitation (rainfall) at Des Moines, IA | Mean = 0.0 mm, annual trend slope = 0.0, historical/future (1981–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Average daily precipitation intensity (SDII) rises from 10.92 mm/d (1981–2020) to 11.29 mm/d (2036–2050) | SDII historical mean = 10.92 mm/d; medium-term projection = 11.29 mm/d | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Marginal trend in SDII, but overall variability and upper extremes increase slightly; rainfall means stationary | SDII trend slope = -0.01 (1981–2020), +0.03 (2021–2035), -0.04 (2036–2050), all non-significant | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble, see above | numeric |\n| 4 | No evidence of abrupt changes in monthly/seasonal rainfall intensity or amount | All monthly means = 0.0 mm in rainfall approximation; SDII varies but not extreme | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble | numeric |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Forced SSP5-8.5 (high emissions), ensemble mean (7 models), grid-based, single location (Des Moines, IA)  \n- Data limitations: Only total (liquid) precipitation and wet-day intensity available; no direct crop yield or flood loss data; single-point results may underrepresent spatial variability  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in precipitation intensity trend direction; moderate confidence in lack of total precipitation change; results representative but not exhaustive\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Incorporate projected increases in precipitation intensity into agricultural borrower risk models, especially for flood-exposed collateral.  \n2. Stress-test portfolios for increased variability in yields and insurance claims related to extreme rainfall, rather than changes in overall precipitation totals.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"SDII\" (Simple Daily Intensity Index) means the average rainfall on days with ≥1 mm precipitation—a measure of rainfall event intensity.  \n- \"Rainfall approximation\" estimates total liquid precipitation (i.e., rain, not snow) based on daily temperature and precipitation.\n\n---",
