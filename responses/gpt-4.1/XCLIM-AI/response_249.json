  "QuestionText": "What are the risks for coffee roasting businesses in Europe that depend on specific quality profiles from climate-vulnerable regions in Central America and Africa?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n### Executive summary\nCoffee roasting businesses in Europe that rely on specific quality profiles from climate-vulnerable regions in Central America and Africa face significant supply chain risks. Climate change is altering temperature and precipitation patterns in these coffee-producing areas, leading to reduced yields, lower bean quality, and more frequent extreme weather events. This can result in unpredictable supply, fluctuating prices, and difficulty in sourcing beans that meet the desired quality specifications.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The answer directly addresses the vulnerability of supply chains tied to specific coffee regions impacted by climate change.\n- This information is crucial for business planning, risk assessment, and the development of adaptation strategies for European coffee roasters.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Climate change reduces coffee yields and affects quality in key regions | Reported decreases in suitable coffee-growing areas and increased pest/disease outbreaks due to rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns | Bunn et al., 2015, Climatic Change; WCR–SCA, 2020; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2022 |\n| 2 | Central America and Africa are especially climate-vulnerable coffee regions | Multiple studies project significant reductions in suitable land for arabica coffee in these areas | Ovalle-Rivera et al., 2015, PLOS ONE; Moat et al., 2017, Global Change Biology |\n| 3 | Supply instabilities and price volatility impact European roasters dependent on specific origin qualities | Observed price fluctuations and temporary shortages linked to climate shocks and disease outbreaks in producing countries | International Coffee Organization (ICO), 2022 Coffee Market Reports |\n| 4 | Quality profiles may be harder to maintain due to change in environmental growing conditions | Shifts in altitude suitability and phenology can alter hallmark flavor qualities | Schroth et al., 2016, Agronomy for Sustainable Development; Läderach et al., 2017, Climatic Change |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The evidence comes from peer-reviewed scientific journals, international organizations (e.g., IPCC, International Coffee Organization), and sector-specific expert reports.  \n- Most sources are model-based climate risk projections or analyses of historic market and crop data.  \n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile there is strong consensus that climate change poses risks to coffee production in Central America and Africa, the degree of impact for specific quality profiles is subject to uncertainties. These include the variability in local climate projections, adaptive responses by farmers, the development of resilient coffee varieties, and market responses. Model projections are sensitive to emission scenarios and local environmental factors. Overall, while the risk is high, the exact timeline and severity for individual supply chains remain uncertain.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Diversify sourcing by incorporating beans from a wider set of regions and origins, prioritizing those investing in climate adaptation and resilience.\n2. Partner with producers and supplier networks to support on-the-ground adaptation measures (e.g., climate-resilient varieties, shade management, and early warning systems).\n\n---",
