  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  What is the potential financial impact of increased summer temperatures on the operating costs (e.g., cooling) for data centers located near Dublin, Ireland, over the next 20 years?. \n\n Do not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected increases in cooling requirements (as reflected by cooling degree days) near Dublin over the next 20 years indicate a likely increase in data center cooling energy demand and associated operating costs.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nCMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble results for Dublin show a marked rise in Cooling Degree Days (CDD, threshold 18°C) from a historical mean of ~77 to 95 (2021–2035), and further to 117 (2036–2050), a ~50% increase over 2021–2050. The number of extremely hot days (Tmax >25°C) also rises but remains low (annual mean increases from 0.33 to 1.2 days). This sustained rise in CDD will directly elevate cooling-related electricity consumption and operational costs for data centers, which are sensitive to cumulative heat load, not just extreme events. The result is a highly robust signal for significantly greater cooling energy expenditures over the coming decades.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Cooling Degree Days (base 18°C) will rise ~50% from 77 (1981–2020) to 117 (2036–2050) near Dublin | Exact ensemble mean: historical 77.1, 2021–2035: 95.3, 2036–2050: 117.0 (units: K·days/year) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950 / highres-future, SSP5-8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Days with Tmax >25°C increase marginally (from 0.33 to 1.2 days/year) | Ensemble mean: historical 0.33, 2021–2035: 0.90, 2036–2050: 1.21 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950 / highres-future, SSP5-8.5) | numeric |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario ensemble mean, inter-model spread is suppressed by averaging; local extremes may vary.\n- Data limitations: Financial impacts are not explicitly calculated—link is via projected CDD as a proxy for increased operating costs; energy price dynamics are not included.\n- Confidence statements: Very high confidence in direction (rising costs via CDD); less certainty in the exact financial translation without economic/engineering inputs.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in high-efficiency and scalable cooling systems to mitigate increased electricity costs driven by ~50% higher CDD.\n2. Consider adaptive design for future expansions (e.g., heat reuse, liquid cooling) to enhance resilience as summers continue to warm.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Cooling Degree Days (CDD): A measure of how much (and for how long) outside air temperatures are above a threshold, directly correlating with building cooling needs.\n- Tmax: The maximum daily air temperature.\n\n---",
