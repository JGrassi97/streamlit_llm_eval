  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will the health impacts of climate change differ between urban and rural populations in India by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2040, urban populations in India will face substantially greater health risks from extreme heat and humidity than rural populations, driven by rising days above 40°C and increasing humidex, particularly due to urban heat island effects and higher population density.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate projections for Delhi (28.6°N, 77.2°E) show a marked increase in annual days with maximum temperatures above 40°C, rising from ~42 days/year (1981–2020) to over 52 days/year by 2036–2050. The annual mean humidex, a key indicator of perceived heat stress, is also projected to rise by more than 2°C over the same period, exceeding human comfort thresholds. Urban residents—exposed to heat island amplification, denser built infrastructure, and limited green space—will experience elevated risks of heat-related illness, dehydration, and mortality compared to rural populations, who may have greater access to shade, ventilation, and adaptation options. The disparity will be exacerbated by poorer air quality and water stress in cities.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Days above 40°C in Delhi will increase by ~10/year from historical to 2040s | 42.5/year (1981–2020), 52.0/year (2036–2050), slope +0.74/year | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Humidex annual mean will increase by >2°C by 2040s over historical | 29.7°C (1981–2020), 31.9°C (2036–2050), slope +0.10/year | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Urban populations face higher heat risk due to urban heat island and limited adaptation | Urban heat islands can raise city center temps by 2–5°C over rural surroundings (literature consensus) | N/A | citation |\n| 4 | Increased heat and humidity raise mortality risk, especially above 40–45 humidex | Humidex >40: severe discomfort, increased risk of heat stroke (official scales) | Government of Canada*; CMIP6 data | text/numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Results based on SSP5‑8.5 (high emission, \"worst-case\") scenario, actual future may differ.\n- Data limitations: Outputs are for a representative grid cell; local microclimates, water access, and infrastructure differences are not resolved.\n- Confidence statements: Very high confidence in projected extreme heat frequency increase; medium confidence in precise urban-rural health impact differential due to local variability.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Urban policymakers should expand heatwave early warning systems, green infrastructure, and hydration access points.\n2. Health agencies must target vulnerable urban populations with outreach, cooling centers, and public education during extreme heat events.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Humidex” is the “feels-like” temperature that includes both heat and humidity, reflecting human heat stress.\n- “Urban heat island” means cities are hotter due to concrete, asphalt, and lack of shade compared to rural areas.\n\n*\\*Government of Canada: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/weather-health/heat-health/health-risks.html*",
