  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  How will an increase in the frequency of intense rainfall events affect flood insurance premiums for residential properties in Houston, Texas, by 2035?. \n\n Do not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2035, projected intensification in extreme rainfall events for Houston is likely to increase flood insurance premiums for residential properties, due to higher modeled flood risk.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nModel projections for Houston, Texas, under the SSP5-8.5 scenario show the 5-day maximum precipitation increasing from a historical mean of 181.7 mm to 184.6 mm in 2021–2035, with a higher interannual variability and more extreme maxima (up to 324 mm). The proportion of wet days remains stable, suggesting that event frequency does not change significantly, but event intensity does. These changes imply higher flood risk, which insurance models translate into increased premiums or stricter policy terms. Insurers will consider the growing potential for extreme rainfall and associated property damage, and homeowners should anticipate cost increases in flood insurance by 2035.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Intensification of extreme precipitation events | 5-day max precipitation mean: 181.7 mm (1981–2020) rising to 184.6 mm (2021–2035), with maximum events up to 324.0 mm | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Higher variability and extremes | Standard deviation increases (34.9 mm historically to 51.0 mm in 2021–2035), highest single event increases from 268 mm to 324 mm | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean | numeric |\n| 3 | Proportion of wet days remains stable | Wet days: mean proportion 0.28 (1981–2020) vs. 0.27 (2021–2035) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean | numeric |\n| 4 | Impact on insurance premiums | Premiums respond to modeled risk, which increases as extreme rainfall intensifies | Insurance industry best practice (N/A) | text |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on SSP5-8.5 (high emissions), multi-model mean; does not include downscaled flood mapping.  \n- Data limitations: No local insurance portfolio data; physical flood model translation to risk/pricing not directly simulated.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trend of more extreme precipitation; medium in direct quantitative premium increase due to lack of local actuarial/pricing models.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Homeowners and stakeholders should anticipate and budget for increased flood insurance costs, and prioritize mitigation (e.g., property floodproofing).  \n2. Municipal and state planners should expand investment in drainage, flood mitigation infrastructure, and update risk mapping in anticipation of heightened extreme rainfall event probability.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **5-day maximum precipitation**: Highest total rainfall over any consecutive 5-day period in a year, a proxy for flood-causing events.\n- **Proportion of wet days**: The share of days per year with measurable precipitation; stable values mean frequency is not changing, but intensity is.\n",
