  "QuestionText": "How will an increase in the frequency of intense rainfall events affect flood insurance premiums for residential properties in Houston, Texas, by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n### Executive summary\n\nBy 2035, the frequency and intensity of extreme one-day rainfall events in Houston, Texas, are projected to remain high, with annual maximum daily precipitation averaging about 130 mm (5.1 inches) per year for the period 2021–2035 under a high-emissions scenario. There is no significant increase compared to the recent historical average, but the flood risk remains elevated. As a result, flood insurance premiums for residential properties in Houston are likely to continue at current high levels, or to increase further if insurance markets account for the persistent threat of intense rainfall and associated flood losses.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly addresses how projected rainfall extremes relate to future insurance costs.\n- Insurance premiums are closely linked to expected flood losses, which are determined in large part by extreme precipitation frequency.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Maximum annual 1-day rainfall near 130 mm projected for 2021–2035 | Model mean: 129.95 mm; standard deviation: 30.54 mm (2021–2035) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | No significant projected increase in short-term extreme rainfall vs. recent historical | Historical mean: 125.82 mm; short-term mean: 129.95 mm; trend not statistically significant (p=0.77) | Same as above |\n| 3 | Liquid precipitation from rain approximation is not resolved in this model for Houston | Rainfall approximation output: 0.0 mm for all periods | Same as above; precipitation likely interpreted as convective rain in this context |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Model-based projections using CMIP6 HighResMIP, a peer-reviewed, internationally recognized ensemble of high-resolution climate models.\n- Quantitative estimates from forced SSP5-8.5 scenario, representing high-end climate change impacts.\n- No use of anecdotal, speculative, or expert-opinion sources; results are from climate model outputs only.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nWhile the CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble mean synthesizes outputs from seven high-resolution global climate models, some uncertainties persist. These include model structural uncertainty (differences between models), internal climate variability, and how well models represent regional convective rainfall extremes specific to Houston. The trend in annual maximum 1-day rainfall from 1981–2035 is not statistically significant, indicating that natural variability is large compared to forced change in this period. Additionally, insurance premiums depend on economic, regulatory, and market factors beyond rainfall projections. Thus, while the flood hazard outlook is robustly high, the translation into future insurance costs carries moderate to high uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Homeowners and prospective buyers should consult up-to-date FEMA flood maps and seek professional insurance advice, as premiums could remain high or increase further, particularly in flood-prone areas.\n2. City and state planners should invest in updated flood risk assessment and resilient infrastructure, ensuring insurance affordability and community protection against extreme rainfall events.\n\n---",
