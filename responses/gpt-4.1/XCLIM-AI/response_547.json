  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate change influence the burden of disease in Central Asian nations over the next 20 to 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising extreme heat events are projected to substantially increase heat-related disease burdens in Central Asia by 2050.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble projections for latitude 41.3°N, 69.2°E (Central Asia) shows an accelerating increase in the annual number of days when both daily minimum and maximum temperatures exceed 22°C and 30°C, respectively: from 11.6 days (1981–2020) to 32.1 days (2036–2050). Hot spell frequency remains high (mean ≈6 per year), but its trend is stable. The tripling of extreme heat days will likely raise the incidence and severity of heat-related illnesses, cardiorespiratory problems, and vector-borne diseases, while straining public health and infrastructure. Urgent adaptation and public health strategies will be required to mitigate these risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Extreme heat days more than double by 2050 | tx_tn_days_above (mean rises from 11.55 [1981–2020] to 32.08 [2036–2050], slope=+0.89/year, p=0.00063) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Hot spell frequency remains stable | Mean hot_spell_frequency: 6.56 (1981–2020), 6.41 (2021–2035), 6.07 (2036–2050); no significant trend (p≥0.16) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean as above | numeric |\n| 3 | Elevated heat event burden linked to health risk | WHO and public health literature directly associate frequent/higher temperature events with increased morbidity and mortality (esp. cardiovascular and respiratory diseases) | N/A | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Only SSP5-8.5 high emissions considered; results may differ under mitigation.\n- Data limitations: Projections based on model ensemble mean for a point location and two indices; other health-relevant factors (air quality, humidity, adaptation) not included.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature projections; moderate confidence for direct disease impacts due to external factors not captured.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Establish and strengthen early-warning heat health action plans—target at-risk groups and urban centers.\n2. Upgrade healthcare and infrastructure resilience for managing heatwaves, e.g. improve cooling access and emergency response.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Hot spell frequency” = number of periods (≥3 consecutive days) above 30°C max temperature.\n- “TX_TN days above” = number of days when both nightly minimum (TN) >22°C and daily maximum (TX) >30°C, capturing compound extreme heat events.\n\n",
