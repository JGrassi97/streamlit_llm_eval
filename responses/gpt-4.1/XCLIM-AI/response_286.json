  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nEvolving climate patterns—specifically, earlier last spring frosts and significant increases in heat accumulation (as measured by Biologically Effective Degree Days, BEDD)—suggest a growing risk of large-scale pest outbreaks, such as the mountain pine beetle, for forestry businesses in the Rocky Mountains near Calgary, Alberta (51.0447N, -114.0708E). Warmer and longer growing seasons promote higher pest survival, more generations per year, and faster population growth.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- More heat (as indicated by increasing BEDD) and earlier last frost dates enable mountain pine beetles to expand, reproduce faster, and survive winters more easily.\n- This information is directly relevant for forestry planning, pest management, and long-term sustainability of forest resources in the Rockies.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Heat accumulation is increasing rapidly through mid-century | Historical BEDD (1981-2020): mean 735.6°Cd; 2036-2050: 911.2°Cd (+24%), with strong positive trend (slope +11.6/yr, p = 0.0011) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Last spring frost is shifting earlier | Historical mean DOY: 133; 2036-2050: 125.5 (approx. 7.5 days earlier); negative trend | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (as above) |\n| 3 | These climate metrics are directly associated in literature with increased pest outbreak risks | Peer-reviewed studies linking earlier frost, increased temperature, and pine beetle outbreaks | Peer-reviewed literature (e.g., Bentz et al., Science 2010; Safranyik & Carroll, 2006) |\n| 4 | Model ensemble results are robust and peer-reviewed | Multi-model mean reduces variability and highlights forced trends; p-values indicate significant trends, especially for BEDD | CMIP6 HighResMIP documentation, peer-reviewed |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- CMIP6 HighResMIP is a peer-reviewed global modeling project used in IPCC reports.\n- Ensemble mean statistics reflect forced climate trends, minimizing uncertainty from individual model variability.\n- Key scientific literature establishing the climate–pest risk link is peer-reviewed.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nWhile the climate projections are based on robust, peer-reviewed global models and reflect a high-emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), uncertainties remain. The ecological response of mountain pine beetle populations also depends on non-climatic factors—such as forest structure, species composition, and pest adaptation—that are not captured in climate-only models. However, the strong and statistically significant increase in heat accumulation and earlier last frost is robust across models, supporting the likelihood of increased pest risk. Model-based projections have known limitations at smaller spatial scales and do not account for possible future mitigation actions.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Forestry businesses should intensify monitoring and adapt management plans for earlier and more severe pest outbreaks, targeting vulnerable stands ahead of projected population expansions.\n2. Consider landscape-level management options (diversification, thinning, species selection) that may increase resilience to both pest outbreaks and climate-driven ecosystem changes.\n\n---",
