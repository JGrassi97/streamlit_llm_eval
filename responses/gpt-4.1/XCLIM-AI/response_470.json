  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will projected changes in average monthly wind speeds affect the power output of offshore wind farms in the North Sea near Denmark by 2050?\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected changes indicate average monthly wind speeds near Denmark will remain stable through 2050, suggesting offshore wind farm power output will not experience significant climate-driven increases or decreases.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble data at 55.47°N, 8.45°E indicates that average monthly mean near-surface wind speeds in the North Sea near Denmark are projected to remain stable through 2050. Yearly means from 1981–2020 (7.26 m/s) to 2036–2050 (7.30 m/s) show negligible change; monthly, typical seasonal patterns persist. There is no robust long-term trend detected, and interannual variability remains similar to historical ranges. Therefore, climate-driven impacts on wind power output are expected to be minimal, and existing wind farm planning assumptions remain valid. Risks and opportunities for energy production due to climate change are low, although extremes in wind (maximum gusts) should be monitored.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Average wind speeds are projected to remain stable through 2050 | Yearly mean near-surface wind speed: 7.26 m/s (1981–2020), 7.30 m/s (2036–2050); no statistically significant trend | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Interannual variability and monthly patterns persist | Standard deviation (std) in monthly means remains similar (e.g., January std: 0.74 m/s historical, 0.99 m/s 2036–2050); seasonal cycles unchanged | Same as above | numeric |\n| 3 | No robust trend in maximum wind speeds | Yearly mean of monthly maximum daily wind speed: 46.27 m/s (historical), 46.17 m/s (2040s); trend slope ≈ 0, p > 0.1 | Same as above | numeric |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: High emissions SSP5-8.5; 7-model ensemble, daily means at ~50 km grid.\n- Data limitations: Multi-model means may smooth localized effects; very local or turbine-height wind changes not resolved.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence for lack of trend in near-surface wind statistics at this spatial/temporal scale.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Continue using current wind resource assumptions for project planning/hub height optimization in this region.\n2. Monitor for evolving research on extremes (gusts and sub-daily variability) and turbine-specific wind stress.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Near-surface wind speed” is the average wind measured close to the ocean surface (~10 m height).\n- “m/s” means meters per second (a common wind speed unit); “ensemble mean” is an average across several climate models.\n\n",
