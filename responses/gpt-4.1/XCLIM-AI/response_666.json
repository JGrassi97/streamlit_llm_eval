  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might temperature increases influence the maintenance needs of electrical grid networks in Tripoli, Libya throughout 2030-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures in Tripoli between 2030–2050 will likely advance the onset and duration of heat events, increasing wear and maintenance demands on electrical grid infrastructure.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of the CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble under the SSP5-8.5 scenario reveals that the first sustained periods of daily mean temperatures exceeding 30°C now occur around day 194 (±10 days) in 2036–2050, approximately 8 days earlier than the historical average. Similarly, the first event of maximum daily temperatures above 40°C occurs on day 191 (±20 days), also earlier by 15 days compared to 1981–2020. This advancement exposes grid components (lines, substations, transformers) to prolonged heat stress, heightening risks of thermal degradation, outages, and wear. The main drivers are the earlier arrivals and increasing persistence of high-temperature periods, requiring grid operators to adapt inspection, cooling, and upgrade schedules accordingly.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                                      | Evidence supporting the statement                                                      | Source                                                                                               | Type    |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| 1 | High temp periods will occur earlier in 2036–2050             | First day of >30°C mean for 3+ days: 194 (±10) vs. historical mean 202, shift ≈ 8 days | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)          | Numeric |\n| 2 | >40°C events will arise much earlier vs. history               | First day of >40°C max for 3+ days: 191 (±20) in 2036–2050, vs. 206 in 1981–2020        | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)          | Numeric |\n| 3 | Maintenance burdens will increase with earlier, longer heat    | Grid exposure to peak ambient temps grows ≈1–2 weeks by 2050, raising risk to hardware  | Derived from above, well-established in electrical engineering literature                            | Inference|\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Uses only SSP5-8.5, ensemble mean of seven models—may not capture full system tail risks.\n- Data limitations: Daily resolution, does not resolve urban microclimates; no direct infrastructure-specific data.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction (earlier, longer heat) but moderate on magnitude (>±7–20 days).\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Advance annual inspection/maintenance windows for critical grid components to precede earlier heat events by at least two weeks.\n2. Invest in heat-resilient equipment and cooling for substations to address increasing thermal loads during extended summer periods.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Day of year” (DOY) means numbered day (e.g., 194 = July 13); “ensemble mean” denotes an average across several climate models to smooth out variability.\n- “Sustained temperature threshold” refers to continuous periods rather than isolated hot days.",
