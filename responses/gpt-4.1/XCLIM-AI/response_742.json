  "QuestionText": "In what ways could shifts in precipitation impact the prevalence of waterborne diseases in Khartoum, Sudan (15.5007N, 32.5599E) through to 2030?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nShifts in precipitation in Khartoum, Sudan through 2030 are projected to result in minimal changes to both the frequency of multi-day wet spell events and total accumulated rainfall, according to the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean under a high-emission scenario. The annual number of wet spells and the average total precipitation show slight or statistically insignificant increases through 2030. However, both high rainfall events and increased rainfall variability can increase the risk of waterborne disease transmission—primarily by overwhelming water and sanitation infrastructure, increasing surface water contamination, and promoting conditions favorable for pathogen survival and spread.\n\n**Key relevance points**:\n- Precipitation patterns (intensity and accumulated totals) directly influence flood risk, water supply quality, and the likelihood of contamination and outbreaks of waterborne diseases.\n- Understanding near-term rainfall trends is critical for health system preparedness, urban planning, and infrastructure adaptation to minimize public health risks.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim                                                         | Evidence                                            | Source                                                                |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Wet spell frequency remains stable through 2030               | 1981-2020 mean: 6.06 events/year; 2021-2035: 6.26   | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | Total accumulated precipitation slightly increases              | 1981-2020 mean: 83.7 mm/year; 2021-2035: 87.7 mm/year | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 3 | High rainfall and wet spell variability increase waterborne disease risk | Epidemiological consensus; see example in WHO/UNICEF | N/A (no direct modeled disease outcome available)                     |\n\n**Source quality**:\n- Wet spell and precipitation data are derived from the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble, recognized as peer-reviewed, state-of-the-art climate projections with high spatial resolution.\n- Relationships between precipitation and waterborne disease are established by epidemiological literature (e.g., WHO/UNICEF reports), but no direct model output for disease is available in this analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty\n\nThe primary sources of uncertainty stem from climate model spread, downscaling limitations, and the absence of direct model projections for waterborne disease outcomes specific to Khartoum. While model ensemble means show little change in wet spell frequency and only a marginal (statistically insignificant) increase in rainfall, individual years still show considerable interannual variability (annual precipitation varying from approximately 46 mm to 120 mm in the 2021-2035 period). Local disease outcomes will also depend on socio-economic factors such as infrastructure quality, public health interventions, and local water management practices—which are not captured in the climate datasets. Thus, while the physical climate signal is moderately robust, implications for disease risk must be interpreted with caution.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Strengthen water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure to better cope with wet spell extremes and variability, reducing potential contamination during heavy rainfall events.\n2. Enhance health surveillance and community outreach for early detection of waterborne disease outbreaks—especially following above-normal rainfall years, even if average conditions show little change.\n\n---",
