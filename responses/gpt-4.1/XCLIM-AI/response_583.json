  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  How will future climate scenarios influence investment risk in the tourism sector of the Caribbean islands by 2035?. \n\n Do not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2035, projected increases in extreme heat and persistent warm nights will substantially heighten climate-related investment risks for the Caribbean tourism sector.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate projections for the Caribbean islands (at 17.06°N, -61.80°W) under high-emissions scenarios indicate a major increase in the frequency of days where both daily maximum and minimum temperatures exceed critical thresholds (mean of 4.4 days/year for 2021–2035 vs 0.35 historically, with a rising trend), and near-constant occurrence of “tropical nights” (>365 days/year). Such sustained heat extremes could adversely impact tourist comfort, health, and destination attractiveness, increase operating costs (e.g., cooling demand), and stress local infrastructure, raising investment risk. These signals emerge clearly from the forced climate model ensemble and should be considered in tourism sector planning.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Almost every night will be a tropical night by 2035 | 365.18 tropical nights/year projected for 2021–2035, vs 365.22 historically (effectively all nights exceed 20°C minimum) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Strong increase in number of days with both extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures | Mean 0.35 days/year (1981–2020) rising to 4.4 days/year (2021–2035), with maximum up to 36.9 days/year in short term; upward trend is statistically significant (p=0.02) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Climate change signal is robust, showing rapid escalation of heat extremes into the mid-21st century | Upward trends in both indicators, especially in minimum+maximum exceedance: trend slope increases from 0.21 (2021–2035) to 0.97 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Results based on high-emission SSP5-8.5, using the 7-model HighResMIP ensemble mean for forced response; does not represent model internal variability or alternative scenarios.\n- Data limitations: Precipitation extremes, storm, and sea level projections excluded; no assessment of socio-economic factors or local adaptation.\n- Confidence statements: Very high confidence in heat-related trends due to model agreement; moderate uncertainty regarding impacts on actual tourist activity.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize investments in heat-resilient infrastructure (e.g., cooling systems, shade) and heat health risk communication.\n2. Diversify tourism offerings to account for reduced comfort during future hot extremes (e.g., promote off-peak or cooler-season activities).\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Tropical night” = A night with minimum temperature remaining above 20°C.\n- “SSP5-8.5” = A scenario assuming high greenhouse gas emissions throughout the 21st century.\n\n---",
