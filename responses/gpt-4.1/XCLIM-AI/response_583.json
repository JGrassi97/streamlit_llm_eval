  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2035, the Caribbean islands (specifically near 17.06°N, -61.80°W) are expected to experience a marked increase in the number of days per year with both minimum and maximum temperatures exceeding 22°C and 30°C, respectively—a shift associated with more frequent, intense heat. In the historical period (1981–2020), such extreme dual hot days virtually never occurred (mean ≈ 0.35 days/year). By 2021–2035, this rises to an average of 4.4 days/year, with the possibility of years seeing up to nearly 37 such days. However, the onset of the first 3-day minimum temperature exceedance each year remains stable, occurring around day 1 (i.e., virtually always early January).\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Elevated frequency of extreme heat days can negatively affect outdoor tourism comfort, increase cooling demands, and impair island ecosystem health—all critical for tourism sector investments.\n- Prospective investors face heightened risks of service disruption, diminished tourist appeal during future hot spells, and greater infrastructure stress.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Extreme heat days (Tx > 30°C & Tn > 22°C) will rise from 0.35 to 4.4 per year by 2035 | Historical mean: 0.35, 2021–2035 mean: 4.4 (max up to 36.86/year) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | The first 3-day sequence with Tmin > 22°C continues to occur around January 1 each year, with no trend | 1981–2020 and 2021–2035 mean: ≈day 1 of year | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 3 | Positive regional trends in dual-threshold heat events, statistically significant for near term | p=0.0216 for 2021–2035 upward trend | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All evidence is model-based, using credible, peer-reviewed global climate models (CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble mean, with high spatial resolution and multiple member averaging). No extrapolation or assumption was made beyond these results.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThis analysis is grounded in the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean, a robust and widely accepted set of climate model outputs designed to reduce individual model bias and internal climate variability. Ensemble means provide higher confidence for projections of average conditions, such as frequency of hot days. Nevertheless, notable variability persists for future periods (standard deviation of 9.56 days/year for extreme heat days by 2035), reflecting possible interannual fluctuations and residual model disagreement. Uncertainties also stem from potential scenario deviations from SSP5-8.5 and the inability of models to capture all local microclimatic and adaptation responses unique to Caribbean tourism settings.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Integrate climate risk screening into all new and existing tourism investments, with particular focus on heat resilience measures (e.g., shaded public areas, high-efficiency cooling, robust energy supply).  \n2. Prioritize flexible, adaptive business models and infrastructure—such as off-peak season promotions or investments in ecotourism less sensitive to extreme heat.\n\n---",
