  "QuestionText": "How will a projected decrease in Sierra Nevada snowpack reduce the water allocations from the Central Valley Project for almond growers near Fresno, California, during the summer months by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBased on available high-resolution climate model data, there is no detectable snowfall (snowfall approximation = 0.0 mm) or rain (rainfall approximation = 0.0 mm) projected at the Fresno, CA, site through 2050. This result implies that, at this exact location and with this data set, no direct snowfall-driven contribution to summer water allocations for almond growers can be quantified for summer 2040.  \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The data shows zero projected snowfall and rainfall for Fresno through 2050.  \n- This finding highlights the absence of modelled solid and liquid precipitation at Fresno city itself, which is distinct from the snowpack trends in the Sierra Nevada headwaters that supply the Central Valley Project.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Projected snowfall at Fresno (36.7378, -119.7871) is 0.0 mm historically and through 2050 | Snowfall approximation: mean = 0.0 mm/yr, trend = 0.0 mm/yr (1981–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Projected rainfall at the same location is 0.0 mm historically and through 2050 | Rainfall approximation: mean = 0.0 mm/yr, trend = 0.0 mm/yr (1981–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | Model results are strictly local and may not capture watersheds feeding the Central Valley Project | Model results are for point: Fresno city coordinates, not the Sierra Nevada drainage basin | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models...) |\n| 4 | No quantified future reduction in water allocation for almond growers can be deduced from direct snowfall/rainfall at this point | Quantitative results from above, and explicit method limitation | See above |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Results are based on peer-reviewed CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble, widely used for climate impact evaluations.\n- Data are model-based, representing mean of 7 high-resolution global models under high-emissions (SSP5-8.5).\n- However, raw outputs are location-specific and do not directly represent Sierra Nevada snowpack or Central Valley Project deliveries, which depend on higher-elevation headwaters and regional hydrology.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty\n\nThere is significant uncertainty in directly linking climate model output for Fresno city to changes in Sierra Nevada snowpack or downstream Central Valley Project water allocations. While the modelled data for Fresno shows no measurable snowfall or rainfall, this does not account for precipitation or snowpack storage in the Sierra Nevada headwaters, which are the primary water source for valley agriculture. The regional hydrologic context, upstream snowfall, and reservoir management are not captured by these point-based results. Therefore, while the data are credible for the specific site, they are not sufficient to robustly project water allocation changes for almond growers near Fresno.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Consult hydrologic and snowpack projections for the Sierra Nevada headwaters, not just local Fresno precipitation, to assess future Central Valley Project allocations.\n2. Engage with local/regional water management and extension services to access watershed-scale model outputs and planning guidance specific to 2040 water risks for agriculture.\n\n---",
