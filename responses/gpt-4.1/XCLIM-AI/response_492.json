  "QuestionText": "How will rising average temperatures influence the need for green spaces and urban forests for cooling in Madrid, Spain, over the next 20 years?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nRising average temperatures in Madrid over the next 20 years are projected to significantly increase the demand for cooling solutions, including green spaces and urban forests. Maximum mean daily temperatures are expected to continue rising, with a notable increase in \"cooling degree days,\" which indicates more frequent and intense heat. This makes urban green infrastructure increasingly vital for mitigating urban heat, protecting public health, and improving comfort.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Rising temperatures and more frequent heat events directly increase the need for shading and cooling—services provided by green spaces and urban forests.  \n- Quantitative projections show a clear trend: more days will require cooling, emphasizing the importance of implementing or expanding urban greening efforts for climate adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Annual maximum of mean daily temperature in Madrid will increase by ~1.2–2.1°C from the recent past to 2050. | 1981-2020 avg: 303.7K; 2021-2035 avg: 304.9K; 2036-2050 avg: 306.1K; linear upward trend observed. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Cooling degree days (CDD, indicative of cooling demand) will increase by ~16% in 2021-2035 and by ~32% in 2036-2050 compared to 1981-2020. | CDD (1981-2020): 919.1 K·days; 2021-2035: 1067.2 K·days; 2036-2050: 1212.1 K·days. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | Increased cooling demand highlights greater public and ecosystem risk without adaptive measures such as urban greening. | Modeled upward trends in both max temperature and CDD; strong statistical significance (p < 0.05). | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The analysis is based on peer-reviewed, internationally recognized CMIP6 HighResMIP climate model ensembles, commonly used in climate science for robust, scenario-based future projections.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nWhile projections from the CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble are considered scientifically robust, uncertainties remain regarding the exact magnitude of temperature increases and local heat effects. These stem primarily from model spread (differences among models), intrinsic climate variability, urban development patterns, and the possibility of mitigation efforts not captured in the scenario (SSP5-8.5 represents a high-emissions trajectory). Nevertheless, all models agree on the direction of trends: increased heat and higher cooling requirements, making the case for urban greening strategies compelling despite precise uncertainty in numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Accelerate the planning and expansion of urban green spaces and urban forests in Madrid, prioritizing areas of highest heat risk and low vegetation cover, to provide natural cooling and improve resilience against rising temperatures.\n2. Integrate projections of future heat and cooling demand into urban planning, building codes, and public health strategies to ensure adaptive measures are commensurate with escalating climate risks.\n\n---",
