  "QuestionText": "How could evolving climate patterns affect the growth of wine tourism in the emerging vineyard regions of southern England over the next 20 to 30 years?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n### Executive summary\nOver the next 20 to 30 years, climate patterns in southern England are projected to continue evolving, with direct impacts on the viability and timing of grapevine growth—critical for wine tourism development. Model-based projections indicate that the start of the growing season (when mean daily temperature exceeds 5 °C for at least 5 consecutive days) is likely to trend earlier, though substantial year-to-year variability remains. This could benefit emerging vineyard regions by allowing for longer or more reliable growth periods, but the variability and possible future season shortening highlight a mixed risk/opportunity profile for wine tourism expansion.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The timing and consistency of the growing season is integral to producing high-quality wine, which underpins wine tourism.  \n- Understanding projected changes informs investors, growers, and the tourism sector about the potential for new plantings, visitor experience timing, and risk management.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | The start of the grapevine growing season is projected to occur earlier or with high interannual variation. | Mean \"growing season start\" (DOY) for 2021–2035 is 17.85±7.33; for 2036–2050 is 14.24±5.92. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950 / highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | The average starting day is projected to be earlier in 2036–2050 compared to the historical average, but with a trend that is not highly significant. | Linear slope (historical: –0.09 DOY/year, near-term: –0.50 DOY/year, mid-term: –0.43 DOY/year), all with p>0.2, so not statistically significant. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean |\n| 3 | There is notable year-to-year variability in the growing season onset, with a standard deviation of about 6–7 days. | Standard deviation (2021–2035: 7.33 days, 2036–2050: 5.92 days) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean |\n| 4 | Quantitative results for the Latitude Temperature Index (LTI) are not available for this location/model. | N/A | N/A |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All quantitative evidence comes from peer-reviewed, model-based datasets (CMIP6 HighResMIP, SSP5-8.5 scenario), which aggregate seven state-of-the-art climate models at high spatial resolution. Results are multi-model means, considered robust for climate signal detection but still limited by inherent model uncertainties and scenario dependence.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThere is moderate to high uncertainty in these projections. While CMIP6 HighResMIP models provide ensemble mean values for the timing of the growing season start, the range of standard deviation (approximately 6–7 days) indicates considerable interannual variability. The linear trend toward earlier starts is present but not statistically significant for the periods examined (p-values >0.2), meaning we cannot rule out variability as a dominant factor. Moreover, projections assume SSP5-8.5 (high emissions); real-world policy or emission shifts may alter outcomes. Limitations also arise from the inability to compute the Latitude Temperature Index for this location due to missing variable or input format constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Vineyard developers and the wine tourism sector should plan for earlier and possibly more variable season starts, adjusting planting, harvesting, and visitor scheduling accordingly.\n2. Stakeholders should monitor evolving climate data and consider supplementary risk management for crop loss or quality variation due to climate variability, potentially integrating climate-resilient grape varieties or adaptive business models.\n\n---",
