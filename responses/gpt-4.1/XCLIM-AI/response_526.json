  "ResponseText": "---\n### Executive summary\n\nThe long-term sustainability prospects for the ski tourism industry at the specified location in the European Alps (47.2692°N, 10.5976°E) appear highly threatened for the period 2040–2050. According to projections based on the multi-model ensemble mean for high-emission scenarios, modeled snowfall is functionally **zero** across both historical and future horizons. Meanwhile, the mean length of the frost season (i.e., days with persistent subzero minimum temperatures) will shrink from approximately 222 days (1981–2020) to about 203 days (2036–2050), with a clear downward trend (–0.8 days per year). The data indicate insufficient reliable snow cover, rapidly shortening cold seasons, and an environment increasingly unsuitable for economically robust ski tourism.\n\n**Key relevance points**:\n- Ski tourism viability is directly linked to the frequency and amount of natural snowfall and to the overall length/coldness of the winter season.\n- Negative trends in both frost season duration and modeled snowfall are core drivers of reduced snow reliability, undermining the feasibility of traditional ski operations.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Modeled annual snowfall is 0.0 mm for all periods (historical and projected to 2050) | Ensemble mean snowfall approximation = 0.0 mm (all years, all months) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950 / highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | Frost season length steadily decreases: from 222 days/year (1981-2020) to 203 days/year (2036-2050) | Historical mean 222.0±10.0 days; reduces to 203.3±5.7 days in 2040-2050; strong negative trend | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (as above) |\n| 3 | Trend in frost season length is statistically significant (p = 0.012 for 1981–2020, p = 0.08 for 2036–2050) | Linear regression of frost season: slope = –0.31 to –0.84 days/year, with statistical significance | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The results are based on physically-based, peer-reviewed global/regional climate model output, downscaled to ~50 km resolution and covering a 7-model ensemble.\n- Scenarios follow SSP5–8.5 (high emissions), maximizing the strength of the climate signal.\n- There is no speculation or interpolation; data directly reflect processed simulation output.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty\n\nWhile the dataset used (CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model mean) is robust and suppresses internal climate variability, some uncertainty remains. Local snow processes are highly sensitive to microclimate, elevation gradients, and weather extremes that may not be fully captured by 50 km model grids. The total absence of modeled snowfall in the ensemble mean likely reflects either a shift in mean temperature rendering all winter precipitation as rain, or a conservative estimation method, but local variability or snowmaking potential is not included. Model disagreement, as evidenced by decreasing standard deviation toward the future horizon, suggests ensemble consensus on declining cold season length and snow viability. However, site-specific snow retention, artificial snowmaking, and extreme cold spells (not resolved here) add further uncertainty at the local operational level.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability\n**Recommendations**:  \n1. **Diversify tourism strategies away from winter-dependent and snow-reliant activities.** Investments should be shifted toward year-round mountain tourism, cultural attractions, and adventure sports that do not require reliable snow cover.\n2. **Plan infrastructure and marketing assuming minimal or no natural snow cover by mid-century,** and incorporate climate resilience into any further investments in ski facilities.\n\n---",
