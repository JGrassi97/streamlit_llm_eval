  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat impact might expected temperature changes have on energy demand in Cairo, Egypt over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreasing temperatures are projected to substantially raise Cairo’s cooling energy demand through higher annual Cooling Degree Days (CDD) over the next two decades.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nEnsemble climate projections for Cairo indicate a marked increase in annual Cooling Degree Days (CDD) through 2050, implying a significant rise in cooling energy demand. From a historical mean CDD of 1,895–2,263 K·days/year (1981–2020), values are expected to reach 2,132–2,479 K·days/year (2021–2035) and further to 2,323–2,655 K·days/year (2036–2050), with linear upward trends (~11–15 K·days/year per decade). These trends, under high-emission SSP5-8.5 forcing, signal increased air conditioning needs and peak electricity loads, particularly during summer extremes, posing risks to energy infrastructure, affordability, and urban resilience.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Cairo’s historical mean CDD (1981–2020) was 1,895–2,263 K·days/yr depending on algorithm | Yearly means: 1,895.4 (CDD), 2,263.4 (CDD approx.), std 116–124 K·days | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Projected CDD for 2021–2035 rises to 2,132–2,479 K·days/yr | Yearly means: 2,132.1 (CDD), 2,479.0 (CDD approx.); 11–15 K·days/yr per decade upward trend | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Medium-term (2036–2050) CDD reaches 2,323–2,655 K·days/yr | Yearly means: 2,322.9 (CDD), 2,655.3 (CDD approx.), per-decade increases persist | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 4 | Statistically significant linear trend in annual CDD over all periods | Slopes: 8.7–15.0 K·days/yr per decade; p-values <0.03, indicating robust trends | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Only high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario included; lower-forcing scenarios may yield less pronounced increases  \n- Data limitations: Ensemble mean suppresses interannual variability; CDD is a climate index, not direct electricity demand; no accounting for socioeconomic or efficiency changes  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction and magnitude of CDD increase under current scenario; moderate in precise societal energy impact\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize investment in energy grid capacity, smart demand management, and resilience upgrades, anticipating higher peak and total loads.  \n2. Promote adoption of building efficiency measures and affordable cooling technologies to buffer demand growth and reduce heat-related health risks.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"CDD\" means Cooling Degree Days: a metric of heat exposure above 18°C, reflecting cooling needs.  \n- \"K·days/year\" indicates the sum of degrees above threshold accumulated across all days in a year; higher means more need for cooling.  \n\n",
