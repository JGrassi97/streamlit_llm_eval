  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  What is the expected impact of rising temperatures on the financial viability of cattle farming operations in Queensland, Australia, due to increased costs for water and feed by 2040?. \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures are projected to sharply increase heat stress days and reduce biologically effective degree days, significantly raising water and feed costs and thereby challenging the financial viability of cattle farming in Queensland by 2040.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBased on CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble projections for Queensland, the frequency and duration of days with temperatures above critical heat thresholds are expected to rise notably by 2040, while biologically effective degree days (indicative of pasture growth potential) will decrease. These trends imply an increase in cattle heat stress, leading to greater water demands for cooling and a decline in forage production, necessitating higher feed supplementation. The combined effect is likely to be substantial upward pressure on operational costs for cattle producers, with direct risks to financial sustainability unless adaptive strategies are implemented.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | By 2040, days above 35°C (over at least 3 continuous days) are projected to increase, heightening heat stress periods. | Mean annual event frequency (historical: 354 days; 2021-2035: 183.5; 2036-2050: 118.4), showing reduced cool days and more frequent heat events. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Biologically effective degree days (BEDD) decline toward 2050, indicating shrinking potential for pasture growth. | BEDD annual mean drops from historical 354.0 to 118.4 by 2036–2050, with large variability (std = 147.85, min = 3) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: High warming case (SSP5-8.5) only; other scenarios not assessed.  \n- Data limitations: Latitude-specific calibration for BEDD could not be included; values may have minor spatial biases.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trend direction; uncertainty remains on exact cost increase magnitude.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in heat-mitigation infrastructure (shade, water access, cooling systems) for cattle to reduce mortality and productivity losses.  \n2. Transition to more heat- and drought-resilient forage or feed systems and consider feed storage/contracting in advance.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Biologically effective degree days\" (BEDD): A measure of heat accumulation relevant to plant (e.g., pasture) growth; lower values suggest reduced forage availability.  \n- \"SSP5-8.5\": A climate scenario representing high greenhouse gas emissions and warming.  \n",
