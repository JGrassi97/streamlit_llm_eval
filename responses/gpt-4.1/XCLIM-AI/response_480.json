  "QuestionText": "How will climate change impact long-term urban development strategies in Jakarta, Indonesia, by mid-century?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBy mid-century, Jakarta is projected to experience a slight reduction or near-stable pattern in total annual precipitation, but with a measurable increase in the intensity of daily rainfall events. This means that while the yearly volume of rain may not change drastically, heavier rainfall episodes are likely to become more common. Such changes heighten Jakarta's flood risk and stress on urban infrastructure, which must be addressed in long-term urban development plans to enhance resilience against climate change impacts.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The analysis is directly relevant to Jakarta’s urban strategies due to its acute flood risk and the need for effective stormwater management in a high-population coastal city.\n- Understanding these trends helps city planners and policymakers prioritize adaptive infrastructure, zoning, and disaster risk reduction efforts for sustainable urban growth.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Total annual precipitation remains nearly stable to slightly decreasing by 2050 | 1981–2020 mean: 2019 mm/year; 2036–2050 mean: 1995 mm/year; statistically insignificant trends | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Daily precipitation intensity increases by mid-century | SDII (mean daily intensity on wet days) rises from 13.66 mm/day (1981–2020) to 14.72 mm/day (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | Trends in annual rainfall are not statistically significant | Annual trend slope ~ -4 mm/year, p > 0.5 (not significant) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (as above) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All data are derived from multi-model ensemble means based on the CMIP6 HighResMIP project (7 global climate models), which is peer-reviewed and widely used in climate science for high-emission future scenarios.\n- Model-based results offer increased robustness compared to single-model studies, but uncertainties remain due to inherent climate variability and model limitations.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nThere is moderate uncertainty in the projected precipitation patterns for Jakarta. While the ensemble mean of seven high-resolution CMIP6 models shows little change or a minor decrease in annual rainfall, individual model differences and internal climate variability mean that actual future rainfall could deviate above or below these projections. The consistent signal across models indicating higher precipitation intensity on wet days (SDII) increases confidence in expectations of more frequent heavy rainfall events. However, substantial statistical uncertainty (p > 0.5 for trends) regarding total precipitation implies urban plans should be flexible and robust to a range of rainfall and flooding outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Integrate enhanced urban drainage, flood protection, and green infrastructure into Jakarta’s long-term development strategy to manage increasingly intense rainfall events.\n2. Prioritize flexible, adaptive land use and building codes to accommodate uncertainty in long-term precipitation totals and reduce vulnerability to extreme weather extremes.\n\n---",
