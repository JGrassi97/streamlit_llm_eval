  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nThe autumn foliage viewing season in New England, USA (at ~43.2°N, -71.6°W), is projected to shift later over the next two decades due to warming temperatures. Specifically, the end of the growing season (a proxy for peak foliage timing) is likely to occur progressively later in the calendar year, while the last spring frost will also occur slightly earlier. This points to a lengthening of the frost-free period and a later onset of autumn leaf senescence, which can delay the peak for fall color displays.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The later end to the growing season means peak autumn color is expected to move further into October or even November by mid-century.\n- This matters for local tourism (foliage-viewing), forest ecology, and the predictability of \"leaf-peeping\" events.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | End of growing season (proxy for autumn senescence) shifts later by ~5 days (2021–2035) and ~8 days (2036–2050) compared to historical | Growing season end mean shifts from DOY 315.33 (historical 1981–2020) to 320.26 (2021–2035) and 323.31 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Last spring frost occurs earlier by ~3 days (2021–2035), ~6 days (2036–2050) compared to baseline | Last spring frost mean DOY moves from 110.53 (1981–2020) to 107.24 (2021–2035) and 104.01 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | The overall frost-free period is expected to increase, lengthening the period between last frost and first hard autumn chill | Inferred from combined shifts in last spring frost and growing season end metrics | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All evidence is based on peer-reviewed, model-based projections using a 7-model ensemble mean from the CMIP6 HighResMIP initiative.  \n- The projections cover both historical and future high-emissions (SSP5-8.5) scenarios and are considered robust for large-scale climatic trends.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile these results are derived from multi-model ensembles (which reduce some model-specific biases), uncertainties remain regarding the exact timing and magnitude of phenological shifts in autumn foliage. Biological responses of forests (i.e., color change triggers) can depend on cues beyond temperature alone, such as precipitation, day length, species composition, and extreme weather events—all factors not directly modelled here. Natural year-to-year climate variability (as reflected in the standard deviation of up to 5 days) adds further noise, and mid-century projections under high emissions have greater uncertainty than near-term trends. Thus, while a later peak in autumn color is very likely, the precise annual date may still vary from year to year.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Tourism boards and event planners should anticipate—and regularly update—the likely timing of peak fall color, shifting informational campaigns later in the season (potentially October to early November by the 2030s–2040s).\n2. Forest managers and ecologists should monitor phenological changes on the ground and adapt conservation or visitor practices to accommodate later leaf senescence and extended growing periods.\n\n---",
