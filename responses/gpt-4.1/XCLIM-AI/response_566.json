  "QuestionText": "How might changing climate conditions affect the character and profitability of tourism in the national parks of the Western USA by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBy 2040, projected climate change in the national parks of the Western USA near latitude 44.4°N, longitude -110.6°W (a representative Yellowstone region) is unlikely to increase the frequency of days with both very high daytime and nighttime temperatures (tasmin > 22°C & tasmax > 30°C). However, the daily variability in the range between maximum and minimum temperatures is expected to show a slight decrease compared to historical levels. These findings suggest that direct heat extremes may remain rare, but subtle changes in daily temperature swings could occur, potentially affecting visitor experience, wildlife activity, and the ecological character of the parks. For tourism profitability, this implies limited direct heat risk through 2040 but possible changes in comfort and ecosystem attributes that could influence visitation patterns.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Quantifies heat extremes relevant for visitor safety and comfort (key for tourism planning).\n- Assesses temperature variability, which relates to ecosystem stability and visitor experience.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Days with both min >22°C and max >30°C are projected to remain at 0 per year through 2040 | Mean = 0 days/year, 1981–2050 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Daily temperature range variability shows a slight decline from historical mean (3.37 K) to projected 2040 mean (3.23 K) | 1981–2020: 3.37 K; 2036–2050: 3.23 K | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | No significant warming trend in daily temperature range variability | Trend slope ≈ 0, not statistically significant (p > 0.1) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Based exclusively on peer-reviewed, standardized multi-model climate projections (CMIP6 HighResMIP).\n- These tools and datasets are widely used in climate assessment and supported by the climate science community.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nThe analysis is based on the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean, which reduces the uncertainty associated with any single model but may mask localized extremes or rare trajectory shifts. While the projections for extreme heat days (joint min/max above threshold) are robustly zero in all periods, this might not fully account for shorter, less severe heat events or regional microclimatic variability. The slight decline in daily temperature range variability is consistent but not statistically significant, adding to uncertainty about the ecological or perceptual impact for visitors. Additionally, these results represent ensemble-averaged conditions—individual years or shorter-term anomalies may still produce notable events.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Continue focusing tourism adaptation efforts on avoiding and mitigating moderate heat risks, as dangerous heat extremes remain rare through 2040 at this site.\n2. Consider monitoring and communicating subtle climate-driven ecosystem changes (flora, fauna, visitor comfort shifts) that might emerge from reduced temperature range variability, to adapt tourism marketing and resource management proactively.\n\n---",
