  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  What are the broad financial risks posed by climate change to the real estate market in South Florida, USA, over the next 30 years?. \n\nDo not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nThe financial risks to South Florida’s real estate market from climate change over the next 30 years cannot be quantitatively evaluated using rainfall and snowfall trends alone, based on available CMIP6 HighResMIP indicators for this location.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)\nFor South Florida (latitude 25.568N, longitude -80.407W), ensemble mean projections from the CMIP6 HighResMIP (hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) show no detectable trend or change in annual or monthly rainfall (liquid precipitation) and snowfall over the next thirty years. While the absence of change in precipitation phase metrics suggests that direct risks from changing rainfall and snowfall are negligible, this analysis alone does not capture key hazards like sea-level rise, flood frequency, or temperature extremes, which are critical for the financial risk evaluation of real estate in this coastal region.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*\n| # | Statement                                        | Evidence supporting the statement                                              | Source                                                      | Type    |\n|---|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| 1 | No change in rainfall trend at provided location | All historical and future means, min, max, and trend slopes are 0.0           | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (rain_approximation) | numeric |\n| 2 | No change in snowfall trend at provided location | All historical and future means, min, max, and trend slopes are 0.0           | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (snowfall_approximation) | numeric |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Only CMIP6 HighResMIP (7-model ensemble, SSP5-8.5), daily, for rain/snow phase.  \n- Data limitations: Only rainfall and snowfall approximations analyzed; no direct input on sea level rise, storm surge, flooding, or property exposure.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in the reported rainfall/snowfall metrics, but very low confidence that this captures the full range of relevant financial risks to real estate in the region.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Supplement this analysis with additional indicators covering sea level rise, flood hazard, extreme rainfall intensity, and temperature extremes.\n2. Conduct scenario-based financial stress-testing using multi-hazard risk metrics tailored for coastal South Florida real estate assets.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Rainfall/snowfall approximations refer to the separation of precipitation into rain and snow based on temperature.\n- \"Trend slope\" describes the yearly rate of change (here, values are 0.0, meaning no detected increase/decrease).\n\n---\n\nIf more comprehensive data are required (e.g., sea level, coastal storm, and socioeconomic exposure), additional tools and sources beyond the provided climate precipitation indicators should be used for robust risk assessment.",
