  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat role will future climate variability play in affecting the resilience of coastal energy infrastructure in Tunis, Tunisia in the coming decades?\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nFuture climate variability in Tunis will exhibit stable-to-slightly decreasing temperature range variability and a marginal increase in precipitation intensity, suggesting energy infrastructure will face moderate but not sharply worsening climate-driven risks up to 2050.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of projected climate indicators for Tunis reveals that the day-to-day variability in daily temperature range is expected to remain stable or decrease marginally (from 1.78 K historically to 1.73 K by 2036–2050), while the intensity of daily precipitation events (SDII) shows a modest increase (from 6.3 mm/day to 6.6 mm/day). These trends imply that, although extremes are not projected to intensify rapidly, slight increases in precipitation intensity could elevate flooding and drainage challenges for coastal energy infrastructure. However, the overall risk is moderate due to the lack of significant upward trends in variability. Continuous adaptation and robust design standards will remain necessary to maintain infrastructure resilience.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Daily temperature range variability will be stable or decrease | Historical mean: 1.78 K; 2036–2050 mean: 1.73 K | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Daily precipitation intensity (SDII) increases slightly | Historical mean: 6.29 mm/day; 2036–2050 mean: 6.6 mm/day | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Results provided for high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5; model range (7-model ensemble) may under-represent outlier outcomes.\n- Data limitations: Focused on two indicators; does not capture all possible extremes (e.g., windstorms, sea level rise).\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in ensemble mean trends for analyzed variables; moderate confidence for unmodeled hazards.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Update drainage and cooling system design standards to accommodate projected increases in event precipitation intensity.\n2. Conduct additional local studies addressing unmodeled hazards such as sea level rise and compound extremes (precipitation + wind).\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"K\" (Kelvin) is a unit for temperature difference; e.g., a change from 10°C to 12°C is 2 K.\n- \"SDII\" (Simple Daily Intensity Index) describes the average rainfall on days with measurable precipitation.\n\n---",
