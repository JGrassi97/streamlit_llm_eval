  "QuestionText": "How might climate trends impact the sustainability of nomadic pastoralism on the Mongolian Steppe by mid-century?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBy mid-century, climate model projections for the Mongolian Steppe near Ulaanbaatar indicate a substantial increase in the frequency of warm nights (tropical nights) and a relatively stable—but slightly decreasing—variability in day-to-day temperature range. Tropical nights, which are currently rare, are projected to become several times more frequent by 2050. These climatic trends could heighten heat stress for livestock and herders, alter pasture growth patterns, and challenge the sustainability of traditional nomadic pastoralism.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Increased tropical nights raise animal heat stress risk and affect night-time recovery for livestock.  \n- Stable daily temperature range variability suggests some climatic stability, but the increase in night-time minimums remains critical for ecosystem, water, and grazing dynamics.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim                                                   | Evidence                                                                                   | Source                                                                              |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Tropical nights will increase from ~0.7 to ~2.8 per yr  | Projected mean of tropical nights rises from 0.71 (historical) to 2.77 per year (2036–2050)| CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | Day-to-day temp. range variability remains stable/slight decline | Annual mean daily temperature range variability changes little: from 2.97 K to 2.92 K | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 3 | Projected values based on high-emission pathway (SSP5-8.5) | All statistics derived using high-resolution (≤50 km) ensemble CMIP6 future projections | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All cited evidence is from peer-reviewed, model-based multi-model ensemble data (CMIP6 HighResMIP), which represents current state-of-the-art climate science and is widely used in international assessments (e.g., IPCC reports).\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nUncertainty in these results arises from model spread, scenario choice, and limited regional detail; however, use of the multi-model ensemble mean suppresses much of the noise from internal climate variability, providing a robust forced-signal estimate. The tropical nights trend, with a mean rising from 0.71 (historical) to 2.77 per year (2036–2050), has some interannual variability (standard deviation historical: 0.53, future: 1.15). The change in temperature range variability is small relative to its absolute value and shows minimal trend. While the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario represents a \"worst-case\" pathway, actual future emissions could differ, potentially altering the magnitude of changes. Local factors (e.g. terrain, land use) are not resolved at finer (herder camp) scales.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Develop heat-resilient livestock management strategies (e.g., provision of shade, water sources, night-time cooling shelters) to brace for increased warm night frequency.\n2. Monitor pasture productivity and animal health closely, adapting migration routes and herd sizes to cope with increased thermal stress and possible alteration of grassland growth cycles.\n\n---",
