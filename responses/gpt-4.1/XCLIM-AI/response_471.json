  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of rising average temperatures and subsequent increased air conditioning load on the efficiency of solar farms in the Atacama Desert, Chile, by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2035, rising temperatures will contribute to higher air conditioning demand and reduced solar panel efficiency in the Atacama Desert, posing increased operational challenges for solar farms.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nCMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble data for the Atacama Desert project a steady rise in both annual cooling degree days approximation (from 1285 to 1354 K·days by 2050) and thawing degree days (from 6321 to 6864 K·days). By 2035, the mean annual cooling degree days increase to 1295 K·days, directly indicating higher cooling demand. Warmer ambient conditions are known to reduce photovoltaic (PV) module efficiency; each 1°C rise above standard test conditions typically decreases panel output by ~0.4–0.5%. Coupled with local surges in air conditioning use, this compounding effect will challenge grid stability and increase operational costs. Results reflect high-emissions scenario SSP5-8.5, based on the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Cooling demand in Atacama Desert will increase by 2035 | Mean annual cooling degree days rises from 1285 (historical) to 1295 (2021–2035), SD: 21.1, trend +2.87 K·days/year | CMIP6 HighResMIP, SSP5-8.5 | numeric |\n| 2 | Average warming accelerates, raising thawing degree days | Mean thawing degree days: 6321 (historical) to 6565 (2021–2035), trend +18.4 K·days/year | CMIP6 HighResMIP, SSP5-8.5 | numeric |\n| 3 | Solar PV efficiency declines with temperature | Typical PV panel output drops 0.4–0.5% per °C above 25 °C (not measured here, general property) | N/A | citation/text |\n| 4 | Combined effect is greater grid load and lower PV output | Higher CDD (cooling demand) coincident with reduced panel efficiency | Derived from above, CMIP6 HighResMIP | numeric/text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis specific to SSP5-8.5 high-emissions pathway; lower-emissions scenarios could yield reduced impacts.  \n- Data limitations: Direct PV efficiency modeling not provided; effect inferred from temperature trends and general engineering knowledge.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature/degree day trends (ensemble mean, p < 0.05 for most trends), moderate confidence in operational magnitude of PV and grid impacts due to site/technology variability.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Integrate PV cooling strategies and select high-temperature-tolerant PV modules for new or retrofit projects.\n2. Expand hybrid system design and energy storage to buffer demand surges and mitigate diurnal output losses.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Cooling degree days” refer to the accumulated measure of how often and how much daily temperatures exceed 18°C, representing cooling energy needs.\n- “PV efficiency” means how well a solar panel converts sunlight into electricity; higher temperatures generally lower this efficiency.",
