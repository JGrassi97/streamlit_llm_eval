  "QuestionText": "What are the expected consequences of climate change for food security in the Horn of Africa over the next 20 years?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n### Executive summary\n\nOver the next 20 years, climate change in the Horn of Africa is projected to substantially increase heat stress on food systems, with direct consequences for crop suitability and yields. The Latitude Temperature Index (LTI), a measure linked to optimal growing conditions (especially for temperature-sensitive crops), is expected to rise by approximately 70 points, from a mean of 1607 (1981–2020) to over 1676 (2036–2050). This upward trend suggests greater exposure to high temperatures during critical growing periods, potentially threatening traditional crop varieties, increasing crop stress, and challenging food security in the region.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The LTI’s strong upward trend directly reflects increasing heat during the warmest month, which can surpass crop tolerance limits, reduce yields, and hinder farmers' resilience.  \n- Quantitative projections like the LTI help anticipate food security risks and inform adaptation strategies, which is crucial for local decision-making.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | The LTI is projected to increase by ~70 points over the next 30 years in the Horn of Africa. | Mean LTI: 1607 (1981–2020), 1645 (2021–2035), 1676 (2036–2050). | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | The trend in LTI is highly significant, indicating robust model agreement on warming. | Trends: Slope = +3.5 per year (p < 0.001) in 2036–2050 window. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean |\n| 3 | Specific local adaptation pressure will increase due to climatic warming, requiring crop and food system changes. | LTI models conditions beyond optimal for many traditional crops; ongoing rise will exacerbate food security risks. | Peer-reviewed usage and calibration of LTI in agricultural suitability studies (see Jackson & Cherry 1988, Kenny & Harrison 1992) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The quantitative results are based on a multi-model ensemble of global climate models analyzed in the latest CMIP6 HighResMIP protocol, which is peer-reviewed and state-of-the-art for climate projections.\n- LTI is a published and peer-reviewed indicator for agricultural risk assessment, widely used in crop and viticultural suitability evaluations.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty\n\nWhile the LTI projections are robust (multi-model agreement, low p-values), uncertainties remain regarding local rainfall variability, extreme event frequency, and how other unmodeled factors (e.g., soil fertility, pest outbreaks, socioeconomic conditions) may mediate food security outcomes. The LTI mainly captures heat-related stress for crops and is less sensitive to changes in precipitation or compound hazards. Therefore, while increased temperatures are virtually certain, the ultimate effect on food security will also depend on adaption capacity, infrastructural support, and crop diversification strategies in place.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Prioritize development and dissemination of heat- and drought-tolerant crop varieties suited to the evolving temperature profile.\n2. Invest in early warning systems and local capacity-building for climate-resilient agriculture (e.g., agroforestry, new planting schedules), matching adaptation to the shifting thermal profile.\n\n---",
