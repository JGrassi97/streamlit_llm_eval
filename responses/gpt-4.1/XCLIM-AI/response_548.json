  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the key public health planning considerations related to climate change for cities in the Great Lakes region of North America?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nCities must address increasing heatwave days and delayed onset of cold weather, both of which heighten health risks and require adaptation in public health planning.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nIn the Great Lakes region, climate projections show substantially increasing numbers of annual heatwave days (as defined by ≥5 consecutive days with daily maximum temperature >25°C), rising from a 1981–2020 mean of 56.6 to 78.7 days by 2036–2050. Concurrently, the first occurrence of cold days (maximum temperature <0°C after July) shifts later in the year, from day 334 (early December) to day 340 (mid-December). These shifts increase risks of heat-related illness, strain on healthcare and infrastructure, and change the seasonality of vector-borne diseases. Urban public health planning should strengthen heat emergency protocols, update health risk communication, and reassess timing for cold weather health services and vulnerable populations.  \n*Source: CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).*\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Annual heatwave days increase from 56.6 to 78.7 by 2050 | 1981–2020 mean: 56.56 days (σ=7.75); 2036–2050 mean: 78.7 days (σ=8.53) | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble mean | numeric |\n| 2 | First day with max temperature <0°C after July shifts ~6 days later | 1981–2020 mean: day 333.6; 2036–2050 mean: day 339.8 | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble mean | numeric |\n| 3 | Both indicators show statistically significant or meaningful trends | Heatwave index slope: +0.45 to +1.02/year; tx_below trend p=0.0199 in 2036–50 | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble mean | numeric |\n| 4 | Health impacts include heat illness, vector-borne disease, energy use, changes in cold weather injury | N/A | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis assumes SSP5-8.5 high-emissions, multi-model ensemble mean (7 models); internal model spread given by standard deviation values above.\n- Data limitations: Only temperature-based indicators assessed; no precipitation, air quality, or socioeconomic vulnerability considered. City-level precision limited by model grid (~50 km).\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in increasing heat extremes and later cold onset; statistical significance robust for 2036–50 trends.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Expand heatwave preparedness programs and alerting, targeting heat-vulnerable populations.\n2. Review timing and resources for cold weather services, adjusting to later cold season onset, and revise public health guidance accordingly.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Heatwave days”: Number of days per year part of an event ≥5 days with daily maximum temperature over 25°C.\n- “First day tx_below”: The first day after July when daily maximum temperature stays below 0°C, marking cold season onset.\n\n",
