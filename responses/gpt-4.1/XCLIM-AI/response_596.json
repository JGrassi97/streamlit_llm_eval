  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  How will the increasing risk of frost damage, due to unseasonal temperature swings, impact insurance costs for vineyards in the Burgundy region of France by 2030?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nQuantitative climate projections indicate a reduced frequency of frost days and a slight trend toward earlier last spring frosts by 2030, suggesting frost damage risk will decrease, which should exert downward pressure on insurance costs—barring other climate volatility factors.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of the Burgundy region’s multi-model CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble mean shows the annual number of frost days declines from a mean of 54.16 (1981–2020) to 43.93 (2021–2035), with the last spring frost occurring earlier (average day-of-year shifts from 92.4 to 84.6). These trends project a modestly lower risk of frost damage to vineyards for 2030, primarily due to regional warming under SSP5-8.5. Insurance costs directly linked to frost losses are therefore expected to decrease. However, residual year-to-year variability (std dev ~4–7 days) persists and other forms of climate volatility could emerge, needing continued risk management vigilance.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                               | Evidence supporting the statement                                                                                            | Source                                                                    | Type    |  \n|---|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|  \n| 1 | Projected frost days decrease by ~19% by 2030           | 1981–2020 mean: 54.16; 2021–2035 mean: 43.93 (slope: -0.21/year, not statistically significant in short-term p=0.37)        | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) | numeric |  \n| 2 | Last spring frost occurs ~8 days earlier on average     | 1981–2020 mean: 92.38 d.o.y.; 2021–2035 mean: 84.56 d.o.y.

Vineyard operators and insurers should expect gradual reduction in frost-related payouts but continue annual reviews as year-to-year variability remains.\n2. Maintain investment in climate monitoring and early warning systems for unseasonal frost events, as rare late frosts may still occur even as average risk declines.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Frost days\": Days where minimum temperature falls below 0°C, relevant for crop damage.\n- \"Last spring frost (d.o.y.)\": The day of the year (from Jan 1), when the last frost event typically occurs in spring.  \n- \"Std dev\": Standard deviation, a measure of year-to-year variability in the indicator.",
