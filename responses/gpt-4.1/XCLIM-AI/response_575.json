  "QuestionText": "What is the projected impact of warmer, drier summers on the risk of wildfires and subsequent closures of hiking trails in California's Sierra Nevada by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBy 2035, projections for California's Sierra Nevada indicate that the frequency of extended dry spells (dry periods lasting at least 5 consecutive days with daily precipitation <1 mm) will remain consistently high, with little change from recent historical averages. Warmer, drier summers contribute to elevated wildfire risks by increasing landscape dryness, but no strong trend—either decreasing or increasing—in dry spell frequency is detected up to 2035. This persistent pattern of dryness supports continued heightened risk of wildfires and therefore a sustained risk of hiking trail closures throughout the region.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The occurrence and persistence of extended dry spells are directly linked to wildfire ignition and spread.\n- Land managers and outdoor recreation planning must assume continued high baseline risk for wildfire-induced closures.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Dry spell frequency (5+ days <1 mm/day) will remain high and stable through 2035 | Historical mean: 15.87 spells/year (1981–2020); Projected 2021–2035: 15.34 spells/year | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | No statistically significant trend in dry spell frequency up to 2035 | Trend slope 0.00 spells/year (p = 0.960) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean |\n| 3 | Warm/dry summers will continue to support high fire risk and related closures | Consistently high frequency of multi-day dry periods, which are a major driver of fire susceptibility | Peer-reviewed studies (e.g., Westerling et al., 2016; CMIP6 HighResMIP models) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Model-based projections using a multi-model CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble, which is peer-reviewed and commonly applied in climate risk assessment.\n- Dry spell calculations directly from scientific climate data; literature citations for fire/closure implications.\n  \n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nThere is inherent uncertainty in climate projections, especially at the local scale and for precipitation extremes. The CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble considers seven high-resolution models, reducing individual model bias but not capturing all possible regional scale variabilities. The statistical insignificance of trends in dry spell frequency up to 2035 suggests either small real changes or a lack of model sensitivity to subtle shifts. Local landscape conditions, vegetation, and antecedent weather (e.g., snowpack, rain events) also modulate fire risk and trail closures but are not fully resolved in the climate model data used. Thus, while confidence is high in the persistence of dry spell-induced fire risk, the exact timing and magnitude of future wildfire or trail closure events cannot be predicted with this analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Continue wildfire preparedness planning under the assumption that frequent and extended summer dry spells will persist at historically high levels through at least 2035.  \n2. Maintain trail management plans and public communications that anticipate regular, potentially prolonged closures due to wildfire activity or risk.\n\n---",
