  "QuestionText": "How is the geographic range for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector for dengue fever, expected to change in southern Europe due to rising average winter temperatures by 2035, for example near Rome, Italy?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2035, rising average winter temperatures near Rome, Italy, are expected to make the region increasingly suitable for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a primary vector for dengue fever. Warmer winters lower the risks of mortality for overwintering mosquito eggs and adults. This will likely enable Aedes aegypti to survive and potentially establish seasonal or even permanent populations in southern Europe, including the Rome area, increasing the risk of local dengue transmission.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Addresses how climate warming, specifically winter temperature increases, enables the northward spread and year-round persistence of a major pandemic vector.  \n- Understanding these changes is crucial for public health preparedness, local vector control planning, and risk communication in regions newly exposed to dengue vectors.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Aedes aegypti is not currently established in most of southern Europe, but rising temperatures will improve its survival chances. | Regional surveillance and climate suitability modelling indicate thresholds for survival and establishment are being approached due to warming. | ECDC 2022; Kraemer et al. 2019 citeturn0search6 |\n| 2 | Projected winter temperatures near Rome by 2035 are expected to exceed the critical lower thresholds for Aedes aegypti overwintering. | Regional climate ensembles (CMIP6 HighResMIP; SSP5-8.5) show average winter minima increasing above 5–7°C, supporting vector survival. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950 / highres-future, SSP5-8.5); Caminade et al. 2012 |\n| 3 | Models project the geographic range of Aedes aegypti to expand into Central and Southern Europe under climate change by mid-21st century. | Distribution modelling with RCP8.5/SSP585 scenarios consistently extends range northward, including central Italy. | Fischer et al. 2013; ECDC 2022; Proestos et al. 2015 |\n| 4 | Evidence of sporadic findings of Aedes aegypti in southern Europe and establishment of Aedes albopictus, a related tropical vector. | Surveillance data & climatic niche comparisons demonstrate expanding risk. | ECDC 2022; Medlock et al. 2012 |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Sources include peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Kraemer et al. 2019, Fischer et al. 2013, Proestos et al. 2015), official surveillance and scientific assessments by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and large-scale model-based climate projections (CMIP6 HighResMIP).  \n- All claims are based on published, model-based, or widely accepted expert-reviewed evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThere remains some uncertainty regarding the precise speed and extent of Aedes aegypti expansion in Italy by 2035, even though models and climate data consistently indicate rising suitability. Factors including local habitat availability, effective mosquito control strategies, accidental introduction events, and urban microclimate effects can accelerate or delay establishment. Additionally, while winter temperature is critical, other determinants such as summer aridity, competition with established vectors (e.g., Aedes albopictus), and public health interventions contribute to uncertainty in actual mosquito population dynamics and dengue transmission risk.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Establish enhanced mosquito surveillance and vector control programs around Rome and other southern European cities to enable early detection and response to incipient Aedes aegypti populations.  \n2. Increase public health awareness and education on mosquito-borne disease prevention, focusing on reducing potential breeding habitats and supporting community-based monitoring.\n\n---",
