  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow is the geographic range for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector for dengue fever, expected to change in southern Europe due to rising average winter temperatures by 2035, for example near Rome, Italy?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2035, average and minimum winter temperatures near Rome are projected to rise, increasing the climatic suitability for Aedes aegypti overwintering and likely enabling persistent local populations in southern Europe.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate model ensemble projections for Rome indicate rising winter mean and minimum temperatures between 2021 and 2035 (mean: 289.4 K, min: 274.4 K) compared to the historical baseline (mean: 288.6 K, min: 273.4 K). This increase of ~1 K in winter minima brings southern European winters closer to the threshold required for Aedes aegypti survival (>10 °C/283 K). As a result, regions like Rome are expected to experience enhanced overwintering potential for this vector, expanding its geographic range and risking more frequent local dengue transmission. Continued warming through mid-century will amplify this trend and public health risk.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                                         | Evidence supporting the statement                                                               | Source                                                              | Type     |\n|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| 1 | Winter mean/minimum temps near Rome rise by ~1 K by 2035          | Historical min: 273.4 K; 2021–2035 min: 274.4 K; means: 288.6 K to 289.4 K                     | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, SSP5-8.5)      | numeric  |\n| 2 | Aedes aegypti requires winter min > 10°C (~283 K) for survival    | Scientific consensus: Overwintering not viable below 10°C mean minimum temperatures            | Waldock et al., PLoS NTD 2013; Ryan et al., eLife 2019              | citation |\n| 3 | Trend indicates further risk increase through mid-century         | Minimum 2036–2050: 275.1 K, continuing positive temperature trend                              | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, SSP5-8.5)      | numeric  |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Uses high-emission SSP5-8.5, multi-model mean; local variability and microclimates not resolved.\n- Data limitations: Mosquito establishment also depends on non-climatic factors (urbanization, containers, vector control).\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in continued winter warming; moderate confidence in establishment potential, as winter minima near but may not always exceed critical threshold for persistent populations.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Initiate targeted Aedes aegypti surveillance in and around Rome and other urban centers in southern Europe.\n2. Invest in vector control and public health preparedness to adapt to emerging dengue transmission risks.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “K” = Kelvin. 273.15 K = 0°C, so 274.4 K ≈ 1.3°C, 289.4 K ≈ 16.2°C.\n- “Ensemble mean” is the average of multiple climate model projections, reducing noise from random yearly variations.\n- “Overwintering” means adult mosquitoes can survive through the winter, increasing local disease risk.",
