  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  What is the anticipated impact of wind speed changes on the insurance sector in Casablanca, Morocco by mid-century?. \n\n Do not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy mid-century, projected daily maximum wind speeds in Casablanca are expected to decrease slightly, implying a potential reduction or stabilization of extreme wind risk exposure for the insurance sector.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate model projections (CMIP6 HighResMIP, SSP5-8.5) indicate that Casablanca will experience a modest decline in both the mean and variability of annual maximum daily wind gusts by mid-century (2036–2050), with the mean maximum wind speed dropping from 40.9 m/s (historical) to 38.0 m/s and the range of extremes narrowing. Minimum annual maxima remain stable (~6.3 m/s). This trend signals a likely stabilization—or possibly a decrease—of risk from extreme wind events for insurers, particularly for property and catastrophe coverage. However, continued monitoring is recommended due to high interannual variability and possible under-representation of rare meteorological extremes.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Projected maximum daily wind speeds slightly decline by mid-century | Mean annual maximum drops from 40.94 m/s (historical, 1981–2020) to 38.01 m/s (2036–2050); standard deviation decreases from 3.02 to 2.12 m/s | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Annual minimum peak gusts remain stable | Minimum annual maximum wind speeds: 6.30 m/s (historical), 6.38 m/s (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Little or no trend in wind extremes over the period | Linear trends: maximum slope –0.07 m/s/yr (p=0.62, not significant), minimum slope –0.02 m/s/yr (p=0.37) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Single high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5); ensemble mean of 7 models at ~50 km; results do not capture rare events beyond simulated distributions.  \n- Data limitations: No sub-daily gust peaks; does not account for non-climatic drivers of insurance risk.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in projected stabilization/decline of median wind extremes; low confidence for the most destructive, rarest wind events.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Recalibrate catastrophe risk models to reflect modestly reduced or stable wind risk through mid-century.\n2. Maintain surveillance for outlier wind events and revisit projections as higher-resolution data and extreme event attribution studies become available.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Ensemble mean” = the average from several climate models; reduces uncertainty from model differences.\n- “m/s” means meters per second, a standard unit for wind speed.\n",
