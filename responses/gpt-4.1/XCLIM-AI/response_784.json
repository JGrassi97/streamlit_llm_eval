  "QuestionText": "What is the anticipated impact of wind speed changes on the insurance sector in Casablanca, Morocco by mid-century?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBy mid-century (2036–2050), projections indicate that the minimum and maximum daily wind speeds in Casablanca, Morocco, will experience slight changes compared to the historical period. The minimum daily maximum wind speed will remain essentially stable, while the maximum daily maximum wind speed is projected to decrease modestly, with a reduction in both mean values and upper extremes by 2050. For the insurance sector, this suggests a very minor reduction in the upper-end wind risk for infrastructure and property, although variability remains present. \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Provides quantitative projections for both lower and upper wind speed extremes, directly affecting wind-related insurance risk and premium calculation.\n- Stability or a slight decrease in extreme wind speeds suggests that catastrophic wind damage claims are unlikely to increase, though continued variation means risk assessments must remain vigilant.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Minimum daily maximum wind speed in 2036–2050 will be similar to the historical mean (6.38 vs. 6.30 m/s) | Mean 1981–2020: 6.30 m/s; 2036–2050: 6.38 m/s; std: 0.27–0.33 m/s | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Maximum daily maximum wind speed decreases from historical mean of 40.94 m/s to 38.01 m/s by 2036–2050 | Historical mean (1981–2020): 40.94 m/s; 2036–2050: 38.01 m/s | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | No statistically significant trend in either wind indicator over historical or future periods (p > 0.2) | p-values for all trends > 0.05 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All data are derived from a multi-model ensemble mean from CMIP6 HighResMIP, representing peer-reviewed, internationally coordinated, state-of-the-art climate model simulations at high spatial resolution.\n- CMIP6 is widely used and accepted by the scientific and risk/insurance communities for climate risk analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nWhile the projections are based on a comprehensive, peer-reviewed multi-model ensemble, there remains inherent uncertainty due to model spread, underlying scenario assumptions (extreme emissions, SSP5-8.5), and regional variability in wind characteristics. Year-to-year variation remains moderate (std ~2–3 m/s for maximum daily wind). The lack of statistically significant historical or future trends (p > 0.2) in both indicators further underscores the stability but also highlights potential limitations in detecting subtle regional changes for extremes (such as rare windstorm events). Realized insurance losses also depend on exposure and vulnerability, not just meteorological hazards; thus, ongoing sector-specific monitoring is advisable.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Review and, if appropriate, modestly adjust wind-related insurance premiums and catastrophe models in Casablanca, reflecting the projected small (but statistically uncertain) reduction in projected extreme wind speeds by mid-century.\n2. Continue systematic monitoring of wind damage claims and exposure levels as year-to-year variability and possible local effects may still yield rare but severe events not fully captured in the multi-model mean.\n\n---",
