  "QuestionText": "What are the forecasts for the Malbec wine industry in Mendoza, Argentina, given projections for changes in water availability from the Andes?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nNo specific quantitative climate projections are available for the Malbec wine industry in Mendoza, Argentina, regarding forecasted changes in water availability from the Andes based on the current dataset and tools. Therefore, no evidence-based assessment of future suitability for Malbec in relation to climate-driven shifts in temperature indices or Huglin index can be provided.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The question directly concerns the climate-driven viability of viticulture (specifically Malbec) in Mendoza, in the context of changing water resources from the Andes.\n- Since relevant climate indices for viticulture could not be computed for this latitude, no numerical guidance can be given for adaptation or risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Climate projections for Mendoza's latitude could not be extracted from the CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble. | Dataset/tool limitations: latitude not found in input dataset. | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | No water availability projections or impacts on Malbec suitability are reported herein. | No quantifiable data retrievable using requested climate indices. | N/A |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Results would be model-based and peer-reviewed if provided; however, no output could be obtained using the relevant ensemble and tools for the given coordinates. No unsourced or speculative content is provided.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nDue to the absence of valid numerical outputs for the geographic location of Mendoza (latitude -32.8895), the uncertainty of this analysis is total. No model-derived indices or direct projections are available for this query. This absence reflects a gap in the dataset's geographical granularity or configuration, rather than inherent uncertainty about the general risks posed by climate change to Andean water supply or viticulture elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Consult regional climate and hydrology assessments or local research institutions for specific projections on water availability and temperature trends for the Mendoza region.\n2. Develop adaptive water management and vineyard planning strategies using local data and sector-specific climate models targeting the Andes-Mendoza catchment.\n\n---",
