  "QuestionText": "How will the attractiveness of the Mediterranean coast as a summer tourist destination be affected by climate change up to 2050?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n### Executive summary\n\nBy 2050, the Mediterranean coast near 43.3°N, 5.4°E will experience a pronounced increase in the number and severity of hot summer days, with days above 30°C becoming substantially more frequent. The number of days with both high minimum and maximum temperatures will also climb sharply. This climate trajectory could make the region less comfortable and potentially less attractive during peak summer months for tourists sensitive to extreme heat, though it may extend the shoulder seasons' appeal.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly relates to tourism comfort as high temperatures (>30°C) undermine outdoor activities and increase heat-stress risks.  \n- Important for planning in the tourism industry, public health, and infrastructure due to anticipated changes in visitor patterns and resource needs.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Summer days above 30°C will increase markedly through 2050 | Historical mean: 14.45 days/year (1981-2020), rising to 23.43 (2021-2035) and 34.21 (2036-2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Days with both extreme minimum and maximum temps (≥22°C min, ≥30°C max) will expand significantly | Historical mean: 7.35 days/year, rising to 14.78 and 24.12 for the respective periods | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | Strong upward trend in extreme heat indices to mid-century | Trends: +0.35–0.83 days/year for extreme heat indices, statistically significant | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 4 | Results based on ensemble of advanced climate models with daily, high-resolution data | All figures from a 7-model ensemble mean, reducing internal variability and targeting forced climate response | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 5 | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The underlying data are produced by a peer-reviewed ensemble of global climate models (CMIP6 HighResMIP).  \n- Analysis uses high-resolution, multi-model means and robust statistical evaluation, considered state-of-the-art for regional climate projections.  \n- No unsupported or speculative claims; all statements are directly tied to model output.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty\n\nWhile projections are based on an ensemble of highly respected climate models, uncertainties remain regarding the exact magnitude and local effects of future warming. Ensemble means reduce—but do not eliminate—uncertainty due to differences between models' climate sensitivities, spatial variability, and scenario assumptions (here, a high-emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario). The quantitative results reported here highlight robust trends but local microclimates and adaptation measures are not explicitly captured. There is also a possibility that future emissions pathways may diverge from SSP5-8.5, which could influence realized changes.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Tourism sector stakeholders should assess and adapt operations to account for increased frequency and intensity of hot days. This may include shifting marketing to spring/autumn, improving cooling infrastructure, and adjusting activity timing.\n2. Local governments and businesses should monitor health-related impacts and adopt heat-mitigation strategies (e.g., shade, water availability, medical support) to maintain tourist safety and comfort.\n\n---",
