  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will future climate conditions impact the mix of renewable energy sources in Germany by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected climate changes by 2035 will have minimal direct impact on the wind and biomass-related renewable energy mix in Germany, with calm days remaining rare and only a slight extension of the growing season observed.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, the mean number of calm days (<2 m/s wind) at Germany’s central coordinates is forecast to increase marginally from 0.06 days/year (1981–2020) to 0.14 days/year, indicating little impact on wind energy resource availability. The growing season end is projected to shift later, increasing from day 315 to day 318 by 2035, suggesting a minor extension for biomass or bioenergy crops. No significant trends threaten wind or bioenergy resource reliability; thus, the renewable energy mix is unlikely to require major climate-driven adjustment. These results derive from the CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble with SSP5-8.5 forcing for Germany. \n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Calm days remain extremely rare through 2035 | Mean calm days: 0.06 (historical), 0.14 (2021–2035), 0.11 (2036–2050) days/year | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Growing season end becomes later | Mean day-of-year: 314.8 (historical), 318.4 (2021–2035), 324.7 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: High emission scenario (SSP5-8.5); applies to multi-model mean at ~50 km resolution.  \n- Data limitations: No direct solar or hydropower metrics in this analysis; only wind and temperature-based proxies.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in minimal change for wind and minor extension for growing season length through 2035.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Continue prioritizing wind in the renewable energy mix, as climate does not threaten annual wind resource availability by 2035.  \n2. Consider small gains for biomass crop planning, but do not expect major shifts in energy yield due to climate change through 2035.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Calm days” = days when average wind speed at 10 meters above ground is below 2 m/s, often considered unsuitable for wind power generation.  \n- “Growing season end” is the first date in a year when mean daily temperature falls below 5°C for at least 5 consecutive days, marking the end of conditions favorable for crop and biomass growth.  \n",
