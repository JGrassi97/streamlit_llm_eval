  "QuestionText": "How will hotter summer temperatures affect the accumulation of sugar and acids, and thus the quality, of wine grapes in the Napa Valley, California, by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nCurrent climate model data cannot provide a quantitative assessment of how hotter summer temperatures by 2035 will specifically affect the accumulation of sugar and acids—and thus the quality—of wine grapes in Napa Valley, California. Key viticulture indices such as the Huglin Index and Biologically Effective Degree Days, which are central to assessing heat effects on grape ripening, cannot be computed due to technical limitations with location-specific inputs.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- No reliable, Napa-specific projections of viticultural heat accumulation indices for 2035 are available from the current ensemble dataset.  \n- Without these indices, we cannot credibly quantify risks related to accelerated sugar accumulation, acid loss, or phenological shifts in wine grape quality in the region for the target timeframe.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Napa-specific viticulture heat indices for 2035 cannot be computed | Technical limitation: required site-specific latitude input not available in validated model dataset | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | No direct projection of heat-driven grape sugar and acid changes is available for this context | No available data at requested location and for required indices | N/A |\n| 3 | Climate models exist but require localized calibration for actionable viticulture risk advice | Data and model structure limitation | N/A |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Model dataset is published, ensemble-based, and peer-reviewed (CMIP6 HighResMIP, multiple global models).\n- However, technical input constraints (inability to inject custom latitude for point-data extraction) mean site-specific analysis is not possible at this time.\n- No unsupported or speculative claims are included.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe main uncertainty in this analysis stems not from variability in climate projections, but from a lack of usable, location-specific results. The models and tools are robust for gridded regional analysis but cannot currently provide Napa Valley–specific indices required to answer the question. Thus, the lack of quantitative findings is due to technical processing limitations, not scientific uncertainty in climate scenarios or ensemble spread.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Work with data providers or technical teams to enable site-specific extraction for viticulture climate risk indices (e.g., by supporting custom point-based latitude/longitude input for the Huglin Index and related metrics).\n2. In the interim, consult regional viticulture extension services or expert groups that may have already downscaled projections or expert assessments for Napa Valley under SSP5-8.5 or analogous scenarios.\n\n---",
