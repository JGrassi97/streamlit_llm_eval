  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow are changing precipitation patterns expected to alter the risk profile and premiums for agricultural insurance policies covering soybean crops in Rosario, Argentina, by 2030?\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2030, the proportion of wet days in Rosario, Argentina is projected to remain nearly stable, implying minimal direct change in the precipitation-driven risk profile and a neutral effect on crop insurance premiums for soybeans, assuming other risk factors remain constant.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nModel projections for Rosario indicate that the annual proportion of wet days (≥1 mm/day) will average 0.20 from 2021–2035, matching the recent historical baseline (1981–2020) with no significant trend. Variability in the daily temperature range also remains steady, suggesting little change in day-to-day weather volatility. Thus, for soybean insurance policies, future risks related to precipitation (e.g., drought, excessive wetness) are not expected to deviate substantially from the historical profile by 2030, supporting stable premium structures. However, continued monitoring is warranted given inherent climate and market uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Proportion of wet days stable (0.20) for 2021–2035 vs. history | Mean wet days proportion 0.20 (2021–2035), 0.20 (1981–2020); trend slope ≈ 0, p=0.88 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | Numeric |\n| 2 | No significant trend or increase in daily temp range variability | Mean yearly variability: 2.69°C (2021–2035) vs. 2.73°C (1981–2020); negligible trend, p=0.92 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | Numeric |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: High-emission SSP5‑8.5 scenario; 7-model ensemble for large-scale signal.\n- Data limitations: Does not capture sub-seasonal extremes or events outside ensemble mean; limited to considered indicators.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in negligible change to annual wet-day proportion for region/period; confidence lower for extreme event risk or non-precipitation hazards.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Maintain current premium structures for precipitation-sensitive soybean crop insurance through 2030, with regular annual reviews as new projections and observed data emerge.\n2. Enhance monitoring of intra-seasonal rainfall variability and potential extremes not resolved by annual wet-day proportion to ensure responsiveness to rare but high-impact events.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Proportion of wet days\" means the percent of days with measurable rainfall (≥1 mm) each year.\n- \"Ensemble mean\" refers to the average result from several climate models, reducing random fluctuations.\n\n",
