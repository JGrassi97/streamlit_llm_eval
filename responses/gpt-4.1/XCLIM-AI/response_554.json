  "QuestionText": "How might warmer, wetter conditions influence the prevalence of Lyme disease, carried by ticks, in the Northeastern United States by 2030?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n### Executive summary\nWarmer and wetter conditions projected for the Northeastern United States by 2030 are expected to create a more favorable environment for ticks that carry Lyme disease. Higher temperatures and increased perceived heat (as measured by the Humidex index) will likely extend the active season of ticks and may encourage earlier activity in the spring and later activity in the fall. Increased humidity also raises tick survival rates. As a result, the geographic range, population density, and season length of Lyme disease–carrying ticks are projected to increase, elevating public health risks in the region, including around New York City.  \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Warmer spring, summer, and autumn temperatures, in combination with rising humidity, directly expand tick activity windows and improve tick survival, increasing Lyme disease transmission opportunities.  \n- This matters for public health planning, ecosystem management, and outdoor workers or recreationists in the Northeastern US who will face higher Lyme disease risks.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Spring and summer Humidex values are projected to increase by ~1.5–2°C by 2030 compared to 1981–2020 | Monthly mean Humidex for May increases from ~17.6°C (1981–2020) to ~18.6°C (2021–2035), June from ~25.5°C to ~26.9°C, July from ~30.8°C to ~32.5°C | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Overall perceived heat stress will be higher and seasonal variability is increasing, lengthening the tick activity window | Monthly mean Humidex for April–October shows a consistent increasing trend, with maximum monthly Humidex values up by up to ~2°C by 2030; p-values for trends mostly <0.1 | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble, Humidex indicator |\n| 3 | Warmer, wetter, and longer warm seasons are empirically associated with higher tick densities and Lyme disease prevalence in the Northeastern United States | N/A (no direct observational evidence in this dataset; inference from climatic proxies) | N/A |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The climatological projections are based on the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble, which is peer-reviewed and includes state-of-the-art climate models.\n- The Humidex is a robust, physically interpretable index.\n- Epidemiological inference regarding Lyme disease risk is based on accepted peer-reviewed scientific consensus but not directly measured in these data. No direct epidemiological modeling from this output set.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe primary uncertainties stem from the translation of climate projections (temperature and humidity) into tick population dynamics and actual Lyme disease incidence. While the CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble provides high-confidence, multi-model-mean climate projections (with evident warming and increased humidex), the biological and behavioral responses of ticks and hosts have additional complexity. Other factors such as land use change, host (deer and rodent) populations, public health interventions, and local microclimate variability are not captured. Additionally, while rising spring and summer temperatures and increased humidity are known to support tick expansion and survival, the actual effect on Lyme disease transmission depends on ecological, behavioral, and social parameters not modeled here.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Public health agencies and local authorities should enhance tick and Lyme disease surveillance, education, and prevention campaigns in the Northeastern US, especially during prolonged spring and summer seasons.\n2. State and municipal land managers should review landscaping, recreational access, and vegetation management policies to reduce tick habitat near human activity zones.\n\n---",
