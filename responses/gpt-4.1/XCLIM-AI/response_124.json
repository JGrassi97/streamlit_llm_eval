  "QuestionText": "How will future climate conditions alter the suitability of southern England for growing new types of horticultural crops, including vineyards?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nFuture climate conditions in southern England (near Latitude 51.27, Longitude -0.75) are projected to bring only a minimal increase in the number of extremely hot days (where both daily minimum temperatures exceed 22°C and daily maximum exceed 30°C) through the mid-21st century. Meanwhile, the end of the growing season is expected to shift slightly later in the year—by about 10 days between the historical period (1981–2020) and mid-century (2036–2050). \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The almost negligible number of extreme heat days suggests only a limited immediate shift toward Mediterranean-type heat extremes, but a modest extension of the growing season provides increased potential for cultivating new horticultural crops (e.g., vineyards) that benefit from a longer frost-free and warm period.\n- These changes foster opportunities to experiment with crops such as wine grapes, though sustained Mediterranean heat extremes remain rare in this timeframe and location.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Extremely hot days (Tx >30°C and Tn >22°C) remain rare | Mean annual days: historical 0.02; 2021–2035: 0.09; 2036–2050: 0.18 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | The growing season end is expected to become later | Mean day-of-year: historical 336.8; 2021–2035: 342.3; 2036–2050: 347.2 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 3 | There is a small but consistent trend towards a longer warm growing season | Season end shifts later by ~10 days from 1981–2020 to 2036–2050 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All data derives from the peer-reviewed, internationally recognized CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble, providing robust, model-based estimates suitable for regional assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nThe projections are based on a high-emissions climate scenario (SSP5-8.5) and represent averaged results from seven climate models at high resolution, minimizing internal variability but still subject to structural model uncertainty. The low absolute number of extreme heat days introduces additional uncertainty—small fluctuations could be significant relative to the mean. Trends in the growing season end are statistically significant in the historical period but less so in future projections due to inherent model differences and natural climate variability. Local adaptation, soil, and microclimate can also modulate crop suitability beyond what is captured at model grid scale, and actual crop success depends on more than just temperature metrics.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Begin trial plantings of new horticultural crops and grape varieties that require somewhat longer, warmer growing seasons, capitalizing on the lengthening frost-free period.\n2. Monitor for microclimate variations and consider site selection criteria optimized for sun exposure and soil, as extreme Mediterranean-like heat remains unlikely—select cultivars tolerant of both extended mild warmth and occasional cool snaps.\n\n---",
