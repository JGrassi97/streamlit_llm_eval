  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will public health systems in sub-Saharan Africa need to adapt to cope with climate-related health threats by 2040?\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nPublic health systems must prepare for increasingly severe and frequent heat events, requiring enhanced heatwave response capacity, health infrastructure adaptation, and targeted protection for vulnerable populations.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, sub-Saharan Africa is projected to experience significant increases in both the intensity and frequency of hazardous heat as measured by the Humidex, with ensemble mean annual values rising from 34.4 °C (1981–2020) to 36.75 °C (2036–2050). The first sustained extreme heat events (≥ 30 °C for ≥ 3 days) will occur earlier and more often, increasing risks of heat-related illness, dehydration, and mortality, especially for children, the elderly, and outdoor workers. Public health systems must implement early warning systems, expand access to cooling and hydration, and strengthen surveillance and emergency response to minimize climate-driven health threats.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Significant rise in Humidex—a key heat hazard index—under climate change | Historical mean (1981–2020): 34.4 °C; 2040s (2036–2050): 36.75 °C; trend slope increases from 0.04 °C/year (historical) to 0.08 °C/year (mid-century) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | Numeric |\n| 2 | Earlier and more frequent onset of sustained extreme heat events | Mean annual first occurrence of ≥ 30 °C for ≥ 3 consecutive days: rises from 127 days (historical, SD 110.8) to 152.7 days (2021–2035), and 69.7 days (2036–2050); high interannual variability | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (see above) | Numeric |\n| 3 | Need for public health system adaptation to heat risks | Observed/projeted Humidex values above 35 °C indicate “great discomfort, avoid exertion” (Canadian Humidex scale); increasing event frequency implies greater health burden | Environment and Climate Change Canada, WHO, CMIP6 HighResMIP | Citation/Text |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis based on high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5; lower emissions could reduce risk magnitude.  \n- Data limitations: Regional/local variability not fully captured; ensemble mean masks extremes; some drivers (e.g., drought, vector-borne disease) not included.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in continued trend of rising heat stress; medium confidence in exact magnitude/timing due to model spread and decadal variability.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Establish and fund early warning and rapid response systems for heatwaves, including public communications and health sector preparedness plans.  \n2. Upgrade health infrastructure (cooling, hydration facilities) and train health workers to address heat illness and dehydration, prioritizing vulnerable populations in both urban and rural areas.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- **Humidex**: An index expressing how hot it feels to humans, including humidity effects. Above 35 °C, physical exertion becomes dangerous.\n- **Ensemble mean**: Average of several climate models to smooth the natural variability and highlight dominant trends.\n- **SSP5-8.5**: A high-emission, worst-case climate change scenario used for projections.\n\nIf you need further explanations, ask for clarification on any technical term.",
