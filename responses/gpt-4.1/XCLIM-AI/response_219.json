  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nThe projected risk of wildfire smoke negatively impacting guest experiences and causing cancellations for farm stays and rural lodges in the Western Cape wine region during the summer months is expected to **increase in coming decades**. This is due to both a rising frequency of hot spells and increasing atmospheric dryness (indicated by the vapour pressure deficit, VPD), both of which are strong contributors to wildfire risk. These climate trends reinforce the likelihood of more frequent and intense wildfires, thus elevating the potential for smoke events that could disrupt hospitality operations and deter bookings during the critical summer tourism season.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The Western Cape’s summer months are already prone to wildfires; projections show that both VPD and hot spell frequency—key drivers of wildfire risk—are rising significantly through mid-century under a high-emission scenario.  \n- Increased wildfires translate directly to higher smoke risk, reduced air quality, visibility impairment, and potential booking cancellations, all of which affect rural and agri-tourism businesses.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) during summer months is projected to increase by 6-10% by 2050 | Jan–Mar mean VPD rises from approx. 915–1050 Pa (1981–2020) to 970–1120 Pa (2036–2050); statistically significant upward trends evident in some months | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Hot spell frequency in summer months will increase by about 36% by mid-century | Annual frequency rises from mean of 6.47 (1981–2020) to 8.82 (2036–2050), with upward trends | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | Wildfire risk is strongly linked to high VPD and hot, dry spells | Peer-reviewed fire science literature (e.g., Seidl et al. 2017; Jolly et al. 2015) consistently shows elevated VPD and hot extremes drive wildfire likelihood and smoke events | Seidl et al. (2017), Jolly et al. (2015) – peer-reviewed fire science |\n| 4 | Hotel and lodge cancellations in Western Cape have increased during past major smoke events | Anecdotal and industry reports from recent Cape fires (e.g. 2017, 2020) | Industry/insurance reports; local news (N/A for long-term future projections) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Climate and wildfire projections are model-based, using peer-reviewed, internationally standardized CMIP6 simulations.\n- Physical linkage between VPD, heat, and fire behaviour is well established in peer-reviewed literature.\n- Tourism/booking impact data for future decades is not available; past impacts are industry-reported.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nWhile the climate models robustly project upward trends in key wildfire drivers (VPD and hot spells), there is considerable uncertainty in translating these into exact impacts on smoke frequency and tourism disruptions. Confidence in the direction of change is high, but the exact occurrence and severity of specific wildfire smoke events depend on factors beyond climate (e.g., landscape management, ignition sources, suppression). Uncertainties also apply to the socio-economic response (e.g., guest risk tolerance, insurance policies, communication strategies) and to the evolution of land management and fire fighting capacity. Nonetheless, the climate signal for conditions favourable to wildfire is strong and model agreement is high for temperature and VPD trends.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. **Develop contingency plans** for smoke event occurrence (e.g., air quality monitoring, flexible booking, and cancellation policies) to mitigate business risk and reassure guests.\n2. **Invest in landscape fire mitigation** around facilities (fuel breaks, defensible space) and coordinate with local fire authorities for preparedness, given the projected increase in hot/dry conditions.\n\n---",
