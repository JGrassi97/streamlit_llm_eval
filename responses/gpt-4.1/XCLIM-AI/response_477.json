  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat role will projected increases in average temperature play in the performance and cooling requirements of geothermal power plants in Iceland through 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected increases in average temperature through 2040 will slightly increase the ambient cooling load for geothermal power plants, but the estimated impact remains minimal in the Icelandic context.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of the Cooling Degree Days Approximation (CDDA) and Latitude Temperature Index (LTI) at latitude 64.08°N (Iceland) under SSP5-8.5 shows a minor increase in summertime cooling needs through 2040. CDDA rises from a mean of 6.27 K·days/year (1981-2020) to 10.04 K·days/year (2021-2035), remaining low in absolute terms. LTI remains at zero, confirming that mean warm-month temperatures stay well below warming thresholds. The modest projected temperature increases are insufficient to materially burden plant cooling systems or impact geothermal resource efficiency. Cooling requirements for power plant operations should remain a negligible operational concern through 2040 in this subarctic climate.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Cooling Degree Days Approximation rises from 6.27 to 10.04 K·days/year | Historical (1981–2020): mean=6.27; 2021–2035: mean=10.04; 2036–2050: mean=10.09 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | LTI remains at 0.0, indicating no high-latitude summer heat risk | LTI mean = 0.0 for all periods (1981–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis uses ensemble mean for SSP5‑8.5, high-end emissions pathway; variability among individual models is suppressed.\n- Data limitations: Indicators are based on area-mean climate model output (≤50 km grid); site-specific microclimates may differ.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence that temperature-driven cooling needs will remain negligible for typical power plant designs in Iceland through 2040.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Maintain standard ambient cooling system specifications; no upgrade necessary due to projected temperature trends.\n2. Continue routine monitoring of site-level ambient temperatures and plant cooling performance as a best practice for operational resilience.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Cooling Degree Days\" (CDD) measure the accumulated amount by which daily temperatures exceed a defined baseline (here, 18°C); higher numbers mean greater cooling needs.\n- \"Latitude Temperature Index\" (LTI) evaluates summer warmth adjusted for latitude, relevant to agriculture and thermal regime characterization; LTI=0 means no significant warm-season heat.",
