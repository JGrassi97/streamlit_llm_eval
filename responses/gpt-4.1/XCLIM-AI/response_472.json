  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will changes in seasonal precipitation and snowmelt affect the annual electricity generation of the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington, USA, by 2040?\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2040, the timing of the spring freshet (snowmelt-driven runoff) near Grand Coulee Dam will be somewhat variable with no consistent advancing trend, and modeled snowfall contribution is effectively zero, indicating that snowmelt-driven inflow to the reservoir is expected to be minimal under the high emissions scenario.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (SSP5-8.5) near Grand Coulee Dam shows the spring freshet start date between 1981–2050 varies and does not show a strong advancing trend (mean DOY: 26 in 1981–2020, 18.9 in 2021–2035, 21.4 in 2036–2050, with statistically insignificant trends). Estimated snowfall contribution remains zero throughout all historical and future periods at this location. These projections strongly suggest a negligible influence from snowmelt on annual inflows by 2040, implying that electricity generation at the dam will depend mainly on direct rainfall and upstream management, with reduced spring runoff seasonality and higher risks from interannual precipitation variability or drought.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Spring freshet start shows no strong trend | Mean day-of-year: 26.03 (1981–2020), 18.91 (2021–2035), 21.42 (2036–2050); all linear trends p > 0.28 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean | numeric |\n| 2 | Snowfall contribution is estimated as zero | All monthly and annual modeled solid precipitation means = 0.0 mm (1981–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean | numeric |\n| 3 | Dataset is multi-model mean (7 models) for SSP5-8.5 scenario | See indicator outputs, 1950–2050, Grand Coulee Dam | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean | text |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Only the multi-model mean for SSP5-8.5 is considered; does not show internal variability or low-emission scenarios.\n- Data limitations: Spatial resolution (~50 km) may under-resolve local orographic effects leading to underestimation of snowfall and snowmelt at site.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in negligible modeled snowfall; low confidence in local spring runoff trends due to above limitations.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Diversify operational inflow forecasting to emphasize direct precipitation and watershed management rather than snowmelt prediction.\n2. Develop contingency strategies for drought and low inflow years, as future reservoir recharge may be less seasonally reliable and less dependent on snowpack.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Day-of-year\" (DOY) means the calendar day counting from January 1 (e.g., DOY 26 = January 26).\n- “Spring freshet” is the seasonal surge in river flow triggered by melting snow.\n- \"SSP5-8.5\" is a high-emission climate change scenario projecting strong warming and reduced regional snowpack.\n\n---",
