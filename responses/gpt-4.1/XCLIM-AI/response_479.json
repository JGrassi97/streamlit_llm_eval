  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected impact of changing precipitation patterns on the viability of run-of-the-river hydropower projects in the Alps of Switzerland by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected precipitation patterns to 2040 suggest little change in the proportion of wet days, indicating relatively stable hydrological conditions for run-of-the-river hydropower in the Swiss Alps.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model projections for the Swiss Alps shows the annual proportion of wet days (precipitation ≥1 mm/day) remains stable (historical mean 0.56; 2040 projection 0.54), with no statistically significant trend (p>0.6). Rainfall approximation using a 0°C threshold for phase discrimination yields negligible change, suggesting a consistent fraction of liquid precipitation. These findings imply that the frequency and phasing of wet weather events, key to run-of-the-river hydropower viability, are not projected to shift markedly by 2040. However, potential changes in event intensity, snowmelt dynamics, or extreme precipitation events are not captured here and may still pose operational and financial risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                                           | Evidence supporting the statement                                        | Source                                                      | Type          | \n|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| 1 | Annual proportion of wet days remains stable to 2040                | Historical (1981–2020) mean: 0.56; 2040 mean: 0.54; trend slope ≈ 0     | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models; SSP5-8.5) | numeric       |\n| 2 | No apparent trend in liquid precipitation fraction                  | Rainfall approximation: mean = 0 for all periods (model procedure result) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models; SSP5-8.5) | numeric       |\n| 3 | Projected changes in wet-day frequency are not statistically significant | Trend p-value (historical to 2040): 0.616–1.0                          | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models; SSP5-8.5) | numeric       |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Results are for SSP5-8.5; only ensemble-mean values used, potential range among models not reported herein.  \n- Data limitations: Only wet-day frequency and binary liquid precipitation phase are assessed; changes in event magnitude, runoff timing, or extremes are not analysed here.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in ensemble mean wet-day fraction projection; lower confidence for operational extremes.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Complement this analysis with indicators of precipitation intensity, seasonal runoff, and extreme events for a comprehensive viability assessment.  \n2. Develop contingency strategies (e.g., flexible operation, storage integration) to manage potential unmodeled extremes or reduced snowpack effects.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Wet day\": A day with at least 1 mm of precipitation.  \n- \"Ensemble mean\": The average output from several climate models to reduce random variability and emphasize robust signals.
