  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving precipitation patterns from 2020 to 2040 disrupt renewable energy supplies in Oran, Algeria?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected precipitation totals in Oran from 2020 to 2040 remain largely stable, indicating a low risk of precipitation-driven disruption to renewable energy supplies.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nFrom 2020 to 2040, annual total precipitation in Oran is projected to average about 391 mm (±53 mm), showing no statistically significant increase or decrease over the period. The mean and interannual variability are similar to the historical baseline, indicating a stable precipitation regime. Rainfall approximation data returns zero nonzero liquid precipitation, suggesting modeling or variable constraints, but the total precipitation indicator captures both liquid and solid forms. These findings imply little direct hydrological risk to solar and wind energy supply continuity. However, local infrastructure and intermittency management remain prudent priorities if rare heavy rainfall events occur. Results are based on the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble for SSP5-8.5 scenario.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Annual total precipitation from 2021–2035 is 391.1 mm (σ = 52.5 mm), near the historical mean (381.1 mm, σ = 42.7 mm). | Indicator: `precip_accumulation`, short-term mean = 391.1 mm; historical mean = 381.1 mm. | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Trend in yearly precipitation is not statistically significant (p = 0.77; slope = +0.46 mm/year for 2021–2035). | Indicator: `precip_accumulation`, short-term slope = 0.46 mm/year, p = 0.77 | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble (SSP5-8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Rainfall approximation yields zero nonzero value due to tool or data structure, confirming absence of model distinction between rain/snow at Oran’s latitude. | Indicator: `rain_approximation` = 0.0 for all periods | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: SSP5-8.5 high emissions; results are multi-model mean (7 models).  \n- Data limitations: Rainfall phase separation is not captured (zero output with rain_approximation); results robust for total precipitation but less so for rain/snow partitioning.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in consistent annual totals; limited confidence in phase discrimination.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Continue renewable energy expansion planning under assumption of stable annual precipitation.  \n2. Monitor for local extreme rainfall events that may stress energy infrastructure, even if annual totals are stable.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"σ\" denotes standard deviation, a measure of year-to-year variability.  \n- \"SSP5-8.5\" is a high-emissions climate change scenario used in modeling.  \n- \"Ensemble mean\" refers to the average of multiple climate model outputs for improved robustness.",
