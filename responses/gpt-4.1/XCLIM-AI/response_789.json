  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will climate change affect the long-term risk projections for infrastructure investments in Agadir, Morocco by 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2050, Agadir is projected to experience a substantial increase in heatwave days but no significant change in liquid rainfall events, implying heightened heat-related infrastructure risks but no emerging rainfall-induced risks.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate projections for Agadir using CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble (SSP5-8.5) indicate a marked increase in heatwave exposure by 2050, with the annual mean number of heatwave days rising from ~144 (1981–2020) to ~179 days (2036–2050), a positive trend of +1.3 days/year (p = 0.033). In contrast, rainfall approximation shows no liquid precipitation risk (mean = 0, all periods), suggesting water stress may persist or intensify. Infrastructure faces escalating risks from prolonged heat stress (material fatigue, energy demand, heat-related service interruption), while the lack of rainfall events limits concern for flood damage. Risk management should prioritize heat adaptation over hydrological resilience for new investments in this region.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Annual heatwave days will increase substantially in Agadir by 2050 | Mean heatwave index: 143.68 (1981–2020) → 179.32 (2036–2050); trend +1.29 days/year, p=0.033 | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | No significant liquid rain events are modelled through 2050 | Rainfall approximation shows mean = 0.0 mm/year for all periods | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: High-emission pathway (SSP5-8.5); output is the ensemble mean of 7 models; local extremes may be underrepresented  \n- Data limitations: Rainfall results may reflect model resolution limitations or regional climate; no intensity data available  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in projected increase in heatwave risk; moderate confidence for rainfall due to model/data constraints\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize heat-resilient infrastructure design (material standards, passive cooling, network robustness).  \n2. Monitor water scarcity risk and maintain contingency plans, given persistent lack of rainfall events.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Heatwave index\" refers to the annual number of days exceeding 25°C for at least 5 days in a row.\n- \"Ensemble mean\" is an average across several climate models, reducing random variability in predictions.",
