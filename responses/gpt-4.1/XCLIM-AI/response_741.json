  "QuestionText": "What are the anticipated effects of changing wind patterns on air quality and public health in Marrakech, Morocco (31.6295N, 7.9811W) by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBy 2040, Marrakech is projected to experience only modest changes in both the maximum and minimum values of near-surface maximum daily wind speeds. No significant trend toward stronger or weaker wind extremes is identified. Given the critical role wind plays in dispersing air pollutants and dust, this relative stability suggests that, all else being equal, wind-driven impacts on air quality and public health in Marrakech will likely remain comparable to present-day conditions. However, other factors (such as local emissions, urbanization, and temperature trends) may play a larger role in shaping future air quality and health risks.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The analysis directly addresses the projected change (or lack thereof) in wind speed extremes, which are relevant for dispersal of air pollution and dust—a key concern for urban air quality and respiratory health.\n- Knowing that not much change is expected from wind extremes allows decision-makers to focus on other drivers of air quality/public health risk that may be more dynamic.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim                                                                                       | Evidence                                                            | Source                                                                                                 |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | No significant trend in annual maximum daily wind speed through 2050                        | 1981-2050 max wind speeds: historical mean = 33.67, 2036–2050 mean = 32.49 m/s; no significant slope | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5), see table   |\n| 2 | No significant trend in annual minimum daily wind speed by 2040                             | 1981-2050 min wind speeds: historical mean = 4.90, 2036–2050 mean = 4.98 m/s; no significant slope  | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5), see table   |\n| 3 | Wind extremes remain within current variability, limiting change in wind-driven air dispersion| Interannual std. deviation overlaps for historical and projected     | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)               |\n| 4 | Air quality/public health outcomes also depend on other factors not addressed by wind alone  | N/A                                                                 | N/A                                                                                                    |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Data is from CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble means, which are expert-reviewed, peer-reviewed, and represent the state-of-the-art in global climate projection science using high-resolution, multi-model averaging to reduce uncertainty from internal climate variability.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nWhile the multi-model ensemble used here reduces internal climate variability and offers robust statistical estimates, several uncertainties remain. These include the inability to resolve local-scale (urban orographic) wind features, the limitation to daily max wind speeds (not gusts), and the absence of direct modeling of air pollutant emissions, chemical processes, or detailed health exposure-response relationships. Furthermore, the large-scale model grid cannot capture local phenomena such as street canyon effects, dust storm thresholds, or microclimate changes from urbanization—all of which could also influence air quality and health independently from the large-scale wind regime. Other anthropogenic and policy factors (e.g., emission controls, infrastructure) are also outside the scope of the climate wind projections.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Maintain or enhance air quality monitoring and public health preparedness in Marrakech, relying on direct measurement rather than expecting wind-driven dispersion outcomes to change substantially.\n2. Direct efforts toward managing local emissions and heat stress, as these are likely to become more prominent drivers for air quality and health under continued warming, regardless of wind changes.\n\n---",
