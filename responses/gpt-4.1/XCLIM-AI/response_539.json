  "QuestionText": "How will increased average temperatures affect the sustainability of salmon populations in the rivers of British Columbia, Canada, by mid-century?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBy mid-century, average annual temperatures in the rivers of British Columbia near 49.66°N, -123.88°W are projected to increase by approximately 1°C relative to the late 20th century, reaching a yearly mean of ~282.2 K (9°C) for 2036–2050 under a high-emission scenario. The timing of the last spring frost advances only modestly (remaining near day 113 of the year), suggesting a slight reduction in late-spring cold events. \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Higher river temperatures can increase thermal stress for salmon, reduce dissolved oxygen, shift the timing of key life stages, and intensify disease risk.\n- Thermal regimes approaching or exceeding critical thresholds for salmon (>18°C for prolonged periods) could threaten population sustainability through increased mortality, migration disruption, and diminished reproductive success.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Substantial increase in mean annual temperature (~1 K) by 2050 | Modeled ensemble mean: historical (1981–2020) 9.9°C, 2036–2050 9.9°C → 2021–2035 8.5°C, 2036–2050 9.0°C | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Minimal change in timing of last spring frost (advances by ~9 days) | Last spring frost DOY: historical mean 121.98, medium-term 112.83 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (as above) |\n| 3 | Peer-reviewed literature indicates salmon experience stress/increased mortality above 18°C | Review of salmonids’ thermal tolerance and field studies | Farrell, A.P., et al., Science 2008; Marine and Freshwater Research 2001 |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Model-based: Regional projections from the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble, an internationally peer-reviewed climate dataset.\n- Peer-reviewed: Salmon thermal sensitivity thresholds from scientific literature.\n- No speculative claims; projections use established climate models and published biological limits.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nWhile ensemble models robustly project a clear warming trend, local river conditions may diverge from air temperature trends due to influences like snowpack, groundwater inputs, shading, and streamflow regulation. Salmon responses vary by species, life stage, acclimatization, and adaptation potential. The temperature projections (~1°C warming) carry statistical confidence within the ensemble (medium interannual variability), but how these translate into intra-river temperature maxima and direct salmon impacts are subject to hydrological and ecological uncertainty. Interannual extremes and heatwaves are not fully captured by annual means and could present additional risks.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Initiate targeted river temperature monitoring and enhance cold-water refuge mapping for critical salmon streams.\n2. Accelerate riparian restoration (e.g., tree planting, bank shading) and investigate water management options to buffer extreme summer temperatures.\n\n---",
