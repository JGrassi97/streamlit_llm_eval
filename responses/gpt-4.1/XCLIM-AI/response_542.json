  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the primary climate-related health risks for populations in Southern California, USA, through 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nThe main climate-related health risks in Southern California through 2050 are increased incidence, duration, and earlier onset of intense heatwaves.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of CMIP6 HighResMIP projections indicates that Southern California will experience significantly more frequent and longer-lasting heatwaves through 2050, with a projected increase of ~29% in annual heatwave days (from 90 days in 1981–2020 to 115 days in 2036–2050). The first sustained periods of high temperatures are projected to begin consistently earlier as well. These trends imply heightened risks of heat-related illnesses, greater pressure on energy systems, and adverse impacts on the most vulnerable populations. Chronic exposure to extreme heat will exacerbate health burdens including heatstroke, dehydration, and cardiorespiratory problems.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heatwave days will increase from a mean of 90/year (1981–2020) to 115/year (2036–2050; +29%) | 90.01 days (historical), 115.67 days (future projection) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | First sustained high-temperature days (>30°C for 3+ days) occur earlier in spring | Historical mean: Day 214; Projected: Day 209 (2036–2050), indicating a ~5 day shift earlier | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on high-end emission scenario SSP5-8.5; actual future emissions or regional mitigation could alter trends.  \n- Data limitations: Ensemble mean used; local extremes or microclimate effects are not resolved, and health impact quantification is not included.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction of trends (more, earlier, longer heatwaves); quantitative magnitude subject to regional factors and adaptation.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Expand heat-health warning systems to cover longer and earlier heatwave seasons; target outreach to at-risk populations.  \n2. Upgrade public cooling infrastructure, grid resilience, and healthcare preparedness for climate-driven heat extremes.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Heatwave index” means the number of days in a year classified as part of a heatwave event—here, defined as 3+ days with daily maximum temperature >30°C.  \n- “First day of sustained high temperatures” is the spring date when a run of hot days begins, signaling early risk periods.\n\n",
