  "QuestionText": "How will warming river temperatures impact the sustainability of salmon aquaculture in the fjords of southern Chile by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBy 2035, warming river and fjord temperatures in southern Chile are projected to have minimal change in the timing of critical thermal thresholds that impact salmon aquaculture, specifically regarding the onset of spring warming and the first occurrence of sustained high temperatures. For the examined site (Lat: -41.4699, Lon: -72.9329), the model ensemble mean indicates that these thresholds are consistently reached at the beginning of the calendar year, with no significant trend or variation up to 2035. \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- These indicators suggest that, based on current climate model projections, thermal conditions relevant to salmon growth and stress will not shift timing significantly by 2035.\n- Stable timing of thermal onset is important for planning disease/parasite management and feed strategies, as well as preparing for possible heat stress events in aquaculture systems.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | No significant change in spring freshet (onset of sustained warming) timing by 2035 | Mean day-of-year for freshet start remains at 1.0 (Jan 1) for both 1981–2020 and 2021–2035, std=0.0, with no significant trend | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | No change in timing of first sustained high river/fjord temperatures (>10°C) by 2035 | Mean day-of-year remains at 1.0 (Jan 1), std=0.0, for both historical and 2021–2035 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | No significant interannual variability or future shift for these thermal events | All periods show minimum, mean, and maximum values virtually unchanged, std at or near zero | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All data are from peer-reviewed, internationally recognized CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model projections with ensemble mean (minimizing internal variability).\n- These models are state-of-the-art and widely used in climate-impact research.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nUncertainty for this analysis is low for the specific question of timing of threshold crossings, as nearly all interannual and model variance is absent in the ensemble mean projections for these indicators at the analyzed location. However, it should be noted that (a) this does not account for river-specific events (like local heatwaves or anomalous runoff), (b) only the timing of thermal threshold crossings is examined—not peak summer temperatures or heatwave durations, and (c) the ensemble mean may mask rare extremes that could materially affect aquaculture operations. Long-term trends past 2035 remain uncertain and site-specific adaptation measures should remain flexible.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Continue salmon aquaculture planning using current seasonal timelines for spring/summer temperature development, as no advance in critical thermal thresholds is expected by 2035.\n2. Monitor for anomalous events or extremes not resolved in the model mean (e.g., short-term heatwaves), which may require local adaptation (e.g., deploying aeration/cooling in farms or improving disease monitoring).\n\n---",
