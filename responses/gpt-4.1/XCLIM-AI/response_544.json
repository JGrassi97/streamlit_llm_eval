  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat public health challenges will arise from climate change in the densely populated river deltas of Southeast Asia over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising heatwaves and extreme humidity will intensify heat-related health risks and stress on vulnerable populations in Southeast Asia's river deltas.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nIn Southeast Asia’s river deltas, climate change will drive a notable rise in both heatwave frequency and humidex (a metric for perceived heat). Over the next two decades, the mean annual number of heatwave days will increase from 352 (1981–2020) to approximately 357 (2036–2050), while annual mean humidex will rise from 37.8°C to 39.9°C. These changes will exacerbate risks of heat-related illnesses, heat stroke, and mortality, particularly among children, elderly, and those with chronic diseases. The increasing humidex amplifies discomfort, complicates adaptation, and can overload healthcare and infrastructure. Targeted adaptation and health warning systems are urgently needed.  \n*(Source: CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)*\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heatwave days will increase over the next two decades | Mean annual heatwave days rise from 352.4 (1981–2020) to 357.5 (2036–2050); standard deviation tightens from 4.09 to 2.17; upward linear trend | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | Numeric |\n| 2 | Humidex—the felt temperature—will reach high risk levels | Mean annual humidex increases from 37.78°C (1981–2020) to 39.93°C (2036–2050); >40°C monthly values expected for several months/year | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | Numeric |\n| 3 | High humidex is linked to increased morbidity and mortality | >40°C humidex classified as \"great discomfort, avoid exertion\"; >45°C poses risk of heat stroke | Government of Canada, Humidex Guide | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Used high-emission SSP5‑8.5 scenario, representative of continued high GHG emissions  \n- Data limitations: Projections are multi-model means; local adaptation or infrastructure evolution not explicitly represented  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in projected warming and humidex rise; moderate confidence in quantifying local vulnerability due to adaptation uncertainties\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Establish and strengthen regional heat health warning systems tailored to at-risk populations.  \n2. Advance heat-resilient infrastructure (cooling centers, green spaces, improved housing insulation).\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Humidex\" describes how hot it feels by accounting for temperature and humidity—higher values mean greater health risk.  \n- \"Heatwave day\" means a day when high temperatures persist for at least five consecutive days, exceeding 25°C each day.",
