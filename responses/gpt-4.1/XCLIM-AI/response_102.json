  "QuestionText": "How will hotter conditions affect the post-harvest handling and storage requirements for agricultural products in India over the next two decades?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nHotter conditions in India over the next two decades will increase the risk of post-harvest spoilage for agricultural products by raising the frequency and total duration of hot spells and elevating annual heat accumulation during the growing season. Both the total length of hot spells (mean annual hot spell days increasing from ~31 days in 1981–2020, up to ~34 days by 2036–2050) and total corn heat units (a proxy of field heat accumulation relevant to storage biology, rising from ~230 to 257 units over the same period) are projected to increase. These trends mean that agricultural products will be more prone to heat-related deterioration, requiring improved cooling, rapid post-harvest handling, and enhanced storage infrastructure to maintain quality and reduce losses.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The projected increase in hot spell days and heat units directly raises product temperatures, driving faster spoilage and greater needs for cooling and humidity control in storage.\n- This information is critical for India’s agricultural sector, post-harvest managers, policymakers, and agribusinesses seeking to plan future-proof storage solutions and minimize food loss risk under climate change.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Total hot spell days per year in central India will rise from 30.8 days (1981–2020) to 34.6 days (2036–2050) | Hot spell total length indicator (mean annual values: 30.8 → 34.6 days) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 2 | Annual corn heat units (CHU) are projected to rise from 229.7 to 256.6 units by 2050 | Corn heat units indicator (mean annual values: 229.7 → 256.6) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5) |\n| 3 | Hot spell frequency and intensity are robustly linked to increased spoilage risk and cooling demand for perishable crops | Peer-reviewed agronomy and post-harvest literature (e.g., FAO, CABI) | N/A |\n  \n**Source quality**:  \n- Claims #1 and #2 are based on model-based, multi-model ensemble mean projections from the high-quality, peer-reviewed CMIP6 HighResMIP dataset.\n- Claim #3 is supported by peer-reviewed scientific literature on crop post-harvest quality and spoilage mechanisms, though a direct citation is not provided in the context of this tool-based dataset.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty\n\nThe quantitative results are derived from the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble, which averages output from seven independent climate models at high spatial resolution under a high-emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5). This ensemble approach reduces the influence of internal climate variability and model-specific biases, thus increasing confidence in the direction and magnitude of projected trends (e.g., rising hot spell days and heat units).  \nHowever, exact future local microclimate conditions, on-farm cooling adoption, and future storage expansions are not represented. The actual impact on product quality and storage losses will also depend on crop type, harvest timing, infrastructure, and adaptation measures. There is some annual and inter-model variability (e.g., standard deviations for hot spell days and CHUs provided above), but the signals are statistically significant over time according to the p-values in the dataset.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Invest in rapid post-harvest cooling and improved insulated storage facilities, scaling capacity especially during the hotter months, to mitigate higher spoilage risk from more frequent/extreme hot spells.\n2. Deploy regular monitoring of storage temperature and humidity, and adjust logistics scheduling to account for anticipated increases in product heat loads and the shorter “safe window” for uncooled storage and transport.\n\n---",
