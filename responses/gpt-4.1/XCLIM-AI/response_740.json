  "QuestionText": "How might temperature rises between 2020-2050 affect public health outcomes in Cairo, Egypt (30.0444N, 31.2357E)?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBy 2050, Cairo is projected to experience a strong increase in days with extreme heat. The number of days where both daily minimum temperature exceeds 22°C and maximum exceeds 30°C is expected to more than double, while days with maximum temperature above 25°C will also increase significantly. This escalation in extreme heat days poses major risks for public health, including more frequent heat stress, greater risk of heat-related illnesses, and increased mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, infants, and those with chronic diseases.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Quantitative projections for extreme heat days directly inform risk assessments for heatwave preparedness, hospital surge planning, and public health warning systems.\n- Understanding the increase in heat extremes helps guide infrastructure, urban design, and social services to reduce heat-related health impacts.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Days where both minimum >22°C and maximum >30°C will rise from ~37/year (1981–2020) to ~89/year (2036–2050), a 141% increase | Model ensemble mean: 37.14 (1981–2020); 88.53 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Days with maximum temperature >25°C will increase from ~238/year (1981–2020) to ~254/year (2036–2050) | Model ensemble mean: 237.7 (1981–2020); 254.31 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | The increase in heat extremes is statistically significant with robust trends | Trend slopes: +0.9/year for combined extreme heat days, p<0.05 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All data come from the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean, using peer-reviewed, global climate models at high spatial resolution and internationally standardized methodology.\n- The scenario used is SSP5-8.5, representing a high-emissions trajectory; this is suitable for stress-testing public health response but may overstate risks if future emissions mitigation is strong.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nWhile the CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble provides robust, model-based projections, uncertainties remain regarding the exact magnitude of temperature increase and resulting health impacts. Sources of uncertainty include natural variability, local microclimates not resolved by ~50 km models, and socio-economic factors influencing public vulnerability and adaptive capacity. The use of a high-end emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) ensures a conservative estimate for planning but could be revised downward if global mitigation efforts succeed. Model agreement across ensemble members is strong for the direction and significance of trends, but the detailed local expression and ultimate health outcomes will also depend on public health infrastructure and societal adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Enhance early-warning systems and community outreach for heatwaves, with specific focus on high-risk days when nighttime minimums remain elevated (>22°C), limiting physiological recovery.\n2. Invest in heat-mitigation infrastructure (e.g., urban green spaces, cooling centers, targeted healthcare resources) to reduce heat stress and protect vulnerable populations, taking into account the considerable projected rise in extreme heat days.\n\n---",
