  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected impact of climate change on energy infrastructure resilience in coastal Louisiana, USA, over the next two decades?\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIn coastal Louisiana, precipitation intensity is projected to remain stable with no significant increase in cold spell frequency through 2050, indicating persistent but not worsening risks to energy infrastructure resilience from these specific hazards.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model projections for coastal Louisiana shows that the Simple Daily Intensity Index (SDII)—an indicator of average precipitation intensity—remains stable over the next two decades, with mean values shifting from 13.23 mm/day (1981–2020) to 13.89 mm/day (2021–2035), and 13.50 mm/day (2036–2050), without a statistically significant trend. The frequency of severe cold spells (mean temperature < –10°C for ≥5 days) remains at zero throughout all periods. These findings suggest that, with respect to precipitation intensity and cold events, future climate does not substantially increase risks for local energy infrastructure; however, other climate hazards (e.g., hurricanes, sea level rise) should be further assessed.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | No significant change in precipitation intensity is projected | SDII mean: 13.23 mm/d (1981–2020), 13.89 mm/d (2021–2035), 13.50 mm/d (2036–2050); trends statistically insignificant (p > 0.27) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Cold spell frequency remains zero | Annual frequency of cold spells (<–10°C for 5+ days): mean 0.0 (historical and future periods) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Climate hazards not addressed by these indicators (e.g., hurricanes, sea level) may still pose risks | SDII and cold spell data shown here do not cover all relevant hazards | N/A | text |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Only SSP5-8.5 (high-emission), multi-model mean; sub-regional effects and other scenarios not assessed  \n- Data limitations: Indicators limited to precipitation intensity and cold spells; extreme wind, storm surge, or heat hazards not included  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in negligible changes for these indicators; other climate risks require further quantification\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Continue to upgrade flood- and storm-resilience of energy infrastructure, given persistent exposure to intense precipitation (mean SDII ~13–14 mm/day).\n2. Supplement this analysis with targeted modeling for hurricanes, sea level rise, and compound flooding, which pose major threats not captured by current indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- SDII: The Simple Daily Intensity Index measures the average rainfall amount on days with meaningful rain (≥1 mm), indicating typical storm intensity.\n- Cold spell frequency: Counts periods of 5 or more days with daily average temperatures below –10°C (not currently observed in this region).  \n\n---",
