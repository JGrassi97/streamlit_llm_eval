  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  How do projected climate shifts alter the risk profile for investors in the global coffee market over the next 20 years?. \n\n Do not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected climate shifts present negligible risk from cold extremes and cold-associated precipitation for coffee production at the specified location over the next 20 years, according to CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble means.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAt latitude 4.8133, longitude -75.756 (a key coffee-producing region), the analyzed climate indicators suggest an absence of cold extremes (first day of maximum temperature below 0°C and days with concurrent high precipitation and low temperatures) both historically and in projections up to 2050 under high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5. This implies minimal direct climate risk from frost or cold-wet events for coffee. Investors’ risk profile related to such extremes remains stable; however, this analysis does not include heat, drought, or extremes outside the evaluated metrics. Continuous monitoring is recommended as risk drivers may shift due to other climatic or agronomic stressors.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | No days with both high precipitation and low temperature were observed or projected | Annual mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of these events = 0.0 (historical: 1981–2020, near future: 2021–2035, mid-century: 2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | No occurrence of first day with maximum temperature below 0°C in any year | Metric returns zero for all periods analyzed | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: SSP5-8.5, multi-model ensemble mean, high-resolution global scale.\n- Data limitations: Only two cold-related indicators computed; does not account for heat, drought, rainfall variability, pests, or diseases.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence for absence of cold-related risks (as measured); other risks unassessed.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Monitor for non-cold-related hazards (heat waves, drought, pests) in climate risk management.\n2. Continue to invest in adaptation strategies against other climate extremes and agronomic threats not addressed by current indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)” is a high-quality climate model dataset, where projected values represent average trends across several global models.\n- “First day of maximum temperature below 0°C” is a standard metric for frost onset risk; “days with precipitation and cold temperature” flags days with simultaneous rainfall and low temperatures likely to affect crops.\n\n",
