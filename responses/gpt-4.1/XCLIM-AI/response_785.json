  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving wind patterns affect financial risk planning in Oujda, Morocco during 2020-2050?\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nMinimum daily maximum wind speeds in Oujda are projected to be stable (~5.1–5.3 m/s) through 2050, implying low wind-related climate risk volatility for financial planning.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of the minimum near-surface daily maximum wind speed in Oujda, Morocco, using the CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (hist-1950/highres-future, SSP5-8.5), indicates little change between 2020–2050. The annual mean of the minimum daily maximum wind speed rises marginally from 5.14 m/s (2021–2035) to 5.27 m/s (2036–2050), with a flat or slightly negative decadal trend (slope ≈ -0.02 m/s/yr, p > 0.19), and low interannual variability (std ≈ 0.2–0.4 m/s). These stable wind conditions suggest minimal impact on financial risk from wind extremes, favoring continuity for infrastructure, insurance, and agricultural planning in this period.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Minimum daily maximum wind speeds stable at ~5.1–5.3 m/s (2021–2050) | Short-term (2021–2035) mean = 5.14 m/s, medium-term (2036–2050) mean = 5.27 m/s, std = 0.22–0.37 m/s | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | No significant trend in minimum wind speed through 2050 | Trend slopes: -0.02 m/s/yr (2021–2050), p-values > 0.19 | CMIP6 HighResMIP (see above) | numeric |\n| 3 | Rainfall approximation shows no liquid precipitation detected for the location and period | All periods (2021–2050): liquid precipitation mean = 0.0 mm | CMIP6 HighResMIP (see above) | numeric |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: SSP5-8.5, ensemble mean of 7 CMIP6 HighResMIP models; local extremes or gusts are not resolved.\n- Data limitations: Only minimum daily maximum wind speed is analyzed; potential changes in wind gusts, storm frequency, or other wind characteristics are not covered.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in stability of this indicator; uncertainty remains for sector-specific exposure to short-term or small-scale wind hazards.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Financial planners should assume stable wind-related baseline risk to 2050, but routinely review asset-level exposure to extreme events not resolved at this scale.  \n2. Integrate continuous monitoring for unforeseen changes in wind extremes or gustiness, as models may underestimate short-term local hazards.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Minimum daily maximum wind speed” is the lowest value recorded of daily highest wind speeds within a year—useful for understanding baseline wind strength but not wind storms or gusts.\n- “Ensemble mean” refers to the average of multiple climate models, reducing random variability to highlight climate-change signals.\n\n---",
