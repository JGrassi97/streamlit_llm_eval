  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of changing monsoon wind patterns on the site selection for new onshore wind farms in western India by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nNo significant change in extreme wind resource is projected by 2035 at the analyzed site, implying continued suitability for wind farm siting based on wind speed metrics alone.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of the maximum and minimum daily near-surface wind speeds at the given location in western India indicates negligible trend in wind extremes through 2035, under a high-emission scenario. The annual maximum wind speeds are stable (mean ≈ 34.5 m/s, trend ≈ -0.05 m/s/year, p=0.69), and the annual minimum maximum wind speeds also show no significant change. This suggests that wind resource potential and risk from extremes will remain similar to present for wind farm site selection by 2035. However, other non-wind factors (e.g., grid access, land use) will likely drive decisions.  \n*Data: CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).*\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | No significant change in annual maximum wind speed by 2035 | 1981–2020 mean: 35.13 m/s; 2021–2035 mean: 34.52 m/s; trend: -0.05 m/s/year, p=0.69 (not significant) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Minimum of maximum daily wind shows stability | 2021–2035 mean: 4.87 m/s; trend: +0.02 m/s/year, p=0.43 (not significant) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models) | numeric |\n| 3 | Variability (std deviation) does not increase markedly by 2035 | sfcWindmax_max std: 2.99 m/s (2021-2035), similar to historical | CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Only high-emission (SSP5-8.5) multi-model mean is analyzed; regional/local effects or low-emission scenarios not represented.  \n- Data limitations: Based on ensemble mean; extremes and sub-grid variability may be underestimated; daily max wind only, not gusts.  \n- Confidence statements: Medium-to-high confidence for ensemble mean trends; local factors and intra-ensemble spread not assessed.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize site selection based on current wind speed climatology; no adjustment required for projected changes through 2035.  \n2. Supplement with finer-scale, local assessments and land/infrastructure constraints for final site decisions.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Maximum daily maximum wind speed\" = the highest wind speed measured at 10m above ground each year.  \n- \"Ensemble mean\" = average across multiple climate models, reducing noise from model-specific quirks.  \n- \"SSP5-8.5\" = a scenario with very high future emissions and warming.",
