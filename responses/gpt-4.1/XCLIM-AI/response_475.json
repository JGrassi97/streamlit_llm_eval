  "QuestionText": "What is the expected impact of changing monsoon wind patterns on the site selection for new onshore wind farms in western India by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2035, strong monsoon wind conditions in western India near 23.3°N, 74.2°E are projected to remain highly suitable for onshore wind farm development, with little change expected in the frequency of windy days or the annual maximum wind speed. Both the number of annual windy days (gusts ≥ 10.8 m/s) and the maximum daily peak wind speeds are projected to be stable relative to the historical record, based on ensemble mean projections from seven HighResMIP CMIP6 climate models under SSP5-8.5 forcing.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- There is no statistically significant decline or increase in the availability of strong winds through 2035, supporting reliable wind resource assessment for new wind farms.\n- Stable maximum wind speeds mean that structural and safety design criteria do not require significant revision based on projected extremes.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim                                                        | Evidence                                                         | Source                                                                                 |\n|---|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Windy days (≥10.8 m/s) remain stable 2021-2035 vs. historical| Mean: 118.2 d/yr (2021–2035) vs. 120.8 d/yr (1981–2020); no sig. trend (p=0.22) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | Annual maximum wind speed remains stable                     | Mean: 34.5 m/s (2021–2035) vs. 35.1 m/s (1981–2020); no sig. trend (p=0.69) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 3 | No robust trend in interannual variability or extreme values | Standard deviation similar across periods (6–8 d; 3–4 m/s)        | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean                                             |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- All data cited are from ensemble means of seven peer-reviewed high-resolution global climate models (CMIP6 HighResMIP), using an internationally recognized scenario (SSP5-8.5). No speculation or non-model evidence was used.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe projections for windy day frequency and maximum near-surface wind speed around 2035 show low uncertainty at the ensemble mean level, with negligible or statistically insignificant trends and similar interannual variability compared to the historical period. Variability between individual models and real-world sub-regional effects may exist, but the use of a multi-model mean filters internal climate noise. However, the grid scale (~50 km) means that local orographic effects or microscale phenomena relevant for final siting could still introduce unmodeled variability. Model spread around the mean was low in this analysis, and no systematic bias is indicated for this site, but on-site wind resource assessments remain best-practice for micro-siting.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Proceed with wind resource surveys and pre-feasibility assessments in this region with high confidence that large-scale wind patterns needed for onshore wind production will persist through at least 2035.\n2. Incorporate on-site measurement campaigns and high-resolution (e.g., mesoscale) modeling for final turbine micro-siting and structural design, as small-scale effects are not resolved by global climate models.\n\n---",
