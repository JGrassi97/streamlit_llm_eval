  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will evolving temperature conditions affect the efficiency of geothermal plants in the East African Rift, Ethiopia by mid-century?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising air temperatures will slightly decrease geothermal plant efficiency in the East African Rift by mid-century, but the impact is minor relative to the resource’s resilience.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy mid-century (2036–2050), the East African Rift region near Ethiopia is projected to experience a significant increase in annual thawing degree days (TDD) and Latitude Temperature Index, driven by rising mean temperatures under a high-emissions scenario. This implies warmer ambient conditions (+9% TDD vs historical), leading to a small reduction in surface heat dissipation and consequently a minor decrease in geothermal power plant efficiency (~0.15–0.25% per °C increase in air temperature). However, geothermal resources remain highly robust to surface climate change, and the projected temperature increments will not substantially impair generation. Adaptive measures (e.g., enhanced cooling systems) can ensure stable output. Significant operational declines are not anticipated.  \n*Data: CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist-1950 / highres-future, SSP5-8.5).*\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Air temperature increase leads to higher annual TDD | TDD rises from 5,885±134 (1981–2020) to 6,417±114 K·days (2036–2050), +9% | CMIP6 HighResMIP (7 models, SSP5-8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Latitude Temperature Index (LTI) increases, reflecting warmer warm-season conditions | LTI grows from 940.5 to 1,019.0 (+8.3%) | CMIP6 HighResMIP (7 models, SSP5-8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Impact on geothermal efficiency expected to be minor | Typical surface temperature increases reduce conversion efficiency by <0.2%/°C; projected ∆T is ~0.8–1.2°C | Literature (e.g., DiPippo, 2016; scenario numbers above) | citation/numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on SSP5-8.5; actual emissions/pathway may differ  \n- Data limitations: Models represent ensemble means; local site variations are not captured  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature trend; moderate in magnitude of efficiency impact due to system design variability\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Evaluate and optimize plant cooling and heat exchanger systems for higher ambient temperatures.\n2. Monitor operational performance and consider minor design adjustments for long-term resilience.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Thawing degree days (TDD)” measure annual sum of daily mean temperatures above 0°C, important for assessing warming.\n- “Latitude Temperature Index” relates warmest month’s temperature, adjusted for latitude, relevant for crop/thermal analyses.\n\n",
