  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the anticipated public health consequences of climate change in the Bay of Bengal region over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising heatwave duration and increasing humidex values are likely to cause substantially greater heat stress, with escalating risks of heat-related illness and mortality in the Bay of Bengal region.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2050, the Bay of Bengal region is projected to experience more intense and longer heatwaves, with the annual number of heatwave days increasing from a historical mean of 319.7 days (1981–2020) to 330.4 days (2036–2050). Simultaneously, the annual mean humidex—a measure of apparent temperature—rises from 35.5 °C to 37.6 °C, with monthly means exceeding 47 °C in pre-monsoon months. These trends indicate worsening thermal comfort, sharply heightening risks of heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and related health burdens, especially among vulnerable populations. The anticipated escalation in extreme heat and humidity underscores an urgent need for adaptive public health and urban planning interventions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Projected increase in annual heatwave days | Heatwave days rise from 319.7 (historical mean) to 330.4 (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Increasing annual mean humidex values | Humidex mean increases from 35.5 °C (historical) to 37.6 °C (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Elevated heat stress risk in pre-monsoon | May mean humidex rises from 44.6 °C to 47.0 °C (2021–2035) and 48.8 °C (2036–2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 4 | Strong upward trend in heat indicators | Monthly humidex increase in pre-monsoon months, significant positive trend (May: slope = 0.10 °C/yr, p ≈ 0.075) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (as above) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario/model range: Analysis assumes SSP5‑8.5 high emissions and multi-model mean suppressing natural variability; lower emissions scenarios would reduce impacts.  \n- Data limitations: Projections rely on ensemble means; regional/local extremes or urban heat island effects may be underrepresented.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in the direction of trends (warming, increasing humidex); precise magnitude subject to model, scenario, and downscaling uncertainty.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement early-warning systems and public awareness campaigns targeting heat risk, especially for extreme humidex values.  \n2. Expand green/blue infrastructure, enforce urban heat mitigation (cool roofing, urban shading), and enhance healthcare system readiness for heat-related illness surges.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- *Humidex* refers to the “felt” temperature combining air temperature and humidity, relevant for estimating heat discomfort and health risk.  \n- *Heatwave days* represent days meeting defined duration and temperature thresholds where extreme heat persists.  \n",
