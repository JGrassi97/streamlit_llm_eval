  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will changing climate patterns affect the potential for renewable energy generation across the Iberian Peninsula by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2040, increasing climatic dryness and stable to slightly increasing near-surface maximum wind speeds may reduce hydropower potential but marginally favor wind energy prospects in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate projections for central Iberia indicate a moderate trend towards drier conditions by 2040, as shown by a declining Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (mean drops from near 0 to -0.18 by 2036-2050), implying increased drought risk and challenging hydropower resources. Conversely, maximum daily wind speeds remain stable to slightly rising (mean ~32.1 to 32.4 m/s, 2036–2050), indicating no adverse trend for wind energy and possible, small increases in generation capacity. These projections, derived from the SSP5-8.5 high-emission scenario ensemble mean, suggest a need for adaptation in water-dependent renewables and an opportunity for enhanced wind energy deployment.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Drier conditions projected for 2040 | Annual SPI mean falls from 0.03 (1981-2020) to -0.18 (2036-2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Maximum wind speeds remain stable/increasing | Annual max sfcWindmax mean: 33.0 m/s (1981-2020), 32.1 m/s (2021-2035), 32.4 m/s (2036-2050) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Hydropower more vulnerable to projected drying | Projected negative SPI trends linked to lower runoff/water storage, reducing hydropower consistency | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on SSP5-8.5 (high emissions); other scenarios may differ.  \n- Data limitations: No direct solar radiation or run-of-river flow data; wind and precipitation indices only.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence for wind/precipitation trends due to ensemble averaging, but no subregional detail.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Diversify investment priorities toward wind energy projects given climatic resilience.  \n2. Implement adaptive management for hydropower: invest in storage and efficiency to mitigate drought impacts.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI): A normalized indicator of wetness/dryness relative to historical baseline (0 = average, negative = drier).  \n- “sfcWindmax_max”: The highest daily wind speed recorded in a year; relates to wind energy generation potential.\n\n",
