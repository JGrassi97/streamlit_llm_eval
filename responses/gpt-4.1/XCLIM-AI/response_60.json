  "QuestionText": "What is the potential impact of changing climate patterns on soil health and the risk of desertification in Spain's agricultural regions by 2050?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBy 2050, climate model ensemble results for central Spain (Madrid region) show that the number of days with rain falling on frozen ground will remain extremely rare (annual mean ~0.01 days/year historically, dropping to zero in future projections), indicating minimal risk of associated surface runoff events. However, attempts to estimate biologically effective degree days (BEDD)—a key indicator for crop growth potential and ecosystem resilience—could not be completed due to technical constraints with latitude input data. This limits the ability to directly quantify the potential for enhanced heat accumulation affecting soil biological processes. Overall, the climate signal suggests extremely low winter freeze/thaw rainfall interaction, but an assessment of heat-driven biological risk to soils remains inconclusive using currently available indicators.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Rain on frozen ground days remain near zero and show no projected increase, implying negligible risk of abrupt soil thaw/flooding events by 2050 in the Madrid region.\n- The inability to assess BEDD prevents direct statements about heat-driven changes to soil microbial activity or plant growth, both of which are crucial in evaluating the risk of soil degradation and desertification.\n- Existing model data is robust for freeze/thaw-precipitation interactions but incomplete for thermal biological processes, which are central to desertification risk.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Rain-on-frozen-ground days are extremely rare and projected to remain at zero by 2050 | Annual mean: 0.01 days/year (1981–2020), 0.0 days/year (2021–2050) for 40.4168N, −3.7038E | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) |\n| 2 | BEDD analysis for heat impact on soil/biota could not be computed | Technical error: latitude field not found in dataset | N/A |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The CMIP6 HighResMIP dataset is peer-reviewed and widely used in climate research, providing multi-model ensemble mean projections at high spatial resolution (~50 km), which enhances credibility regarding physical climate indices.\n- Technical gaps (missing latitude field) are a limitation of data processing, not the underlying science.\n- No expert/empirical ground data is cited; evidence is purely model-based.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nWhile the ensemble projections for rain on frozen ground days are clear and robust due to the use of multi-model averaging, uncertainty persists regarding biologically effective degree days due to data processing limitations. This restricts direct insight into soil temperature regimes and biological activity, which are critical determinants of soil health and desertification potential. Furthermore, model outputs represent broad grid averages and may not capture localized microclimatic conditions or impacts from land management practices, both of which can substantially influence desertification risk.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Supplement model-based assessments with ground-monitoring of soil temperature, moisture, and organic activity to better quantify heat-driven risks to soil health and desertification under changing climates.\n2. Advocate for improved data provision and model variable completeness (including precise latitude referencing) in climate services targeting soil and agricultural risk assessment in Spain.\n\n---",
