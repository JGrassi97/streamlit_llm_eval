  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the forecasts for the viability of renewable energy infrastructure in coastal regions of Australia given climate projections for 2040-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected increases in heat wave frequency and stable extreme wind speeds suggest moderate but manageable risks to renewable energy infrastructure viability in coastal Australia (2040–2050).\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nFuture climate projections for coastal Australia (2040-2050) indicate that heat wave frequency will roughly quadruple compared to recent decades, rising to a mean of 0.54 events/year (from 0.14 historically). However, maximum near-surface wind speeds show no significant increase, remaining stable around 47.7 m/s. This implies renewable energy infrastructure (solar, wind) will face more frequent heat stress but not increased wind risk. Technological choices, site design, and maintenance schedules should target heat resilience. Wind turbine viability and structural design requirements will not require substantial adjustment for stronger extremes, but cooling and operational efficiency of solar and grid assets will be increasingly important. Dataset: CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Heat wave frequency rises from 0.14 (±0.15) to 0.54 (±0.35) events/year | 1981-2020 mean 0.14, 2036-2050 mean 0.54 events/year | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Maximum wind speed remains stable (historical 47.7 ± 2.1 m/s; 2040-2050: 47.7 ± 1.9 m/s) | Historical max 52.4 m/s, projected (2040-2050) max 53.2 m/s; no significant trend | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Results refer to high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario; other scenarios may yield different risk magnitudes  \n- Data limitations: Does not resolve sub-daily extremes or localized hazard microclimates; model spread not shown  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in mean values and trends for these broad metrics; medium confidence in asset-specific outcomes\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize heat-resilient materials and active/passive cooling for solar PV and support infrastructure  \n2. Update operational protocols to account for more frequent heat-related curtailments and maintenance in energy planning\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Heat wave frequency\" means the number of multi-day extreme heat events per year (per the CMIP6 indicator definition).  \n- \"Maximum wind speed\" here refers to the annual maximum daily near-surface wind gust modeled by climate simulations.\n\n",
