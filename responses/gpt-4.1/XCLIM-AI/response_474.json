  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might an increase in calm, low-wind days affect the reliability of wind power generation in the state of Iowa, USA, over the next decade?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nNo statistically significant increase in calm, low-wind days is projected for Iowa over the next decade, indicating minimal impact on wind power reliability.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean data for Iowa (1981–2050) indicates that the frequency of calm days (wind speed <2 m/s) remains extremely low (~0.01 days/year) with no upward trend projected for 2021–2035 or 2036–2050. Windy days (wind speed ≥10.8 m/s) are projected to remain stable (~266–267 days/year), with no significant trends observed. Consequently, the reliability of wind power generation in Iowa is unlikely to be compromised by increases in calm days over the next decade. These results support continued confidence in wind resource availability, though operational planning should always account for potential short-term variability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                                          | Evidence supporting the statement                       | Source                                                                                                 | Type     | \n|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| 1 | Calm days remain extremely rare through next 30 years               | Mean: 0.01 days/year (2021–2035, 2036–2050); no trend  | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)            | numeric  |\n| 2 | No significant increase in calm day frequency is projected          | Trend in calm days ≤0.0, p>0.7 for both future periods | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)            | numeric  |\n| 3 | Windy days (≥10.8 m/s) remain stable with no significant change     | Mean: ~266 days/year, no significant trend (p>0.5)     | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5)            | numeric  |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis is based on the high-emissions SSP5–8.5 scenario; ensemble mean suppresses internal climate variability.  \n- Data limitations: Only daily-mean wind speed at coarse spatial and temporal resolution; local effects, turbine-height winds, and sub-daily variability are not captured.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in the absence of significant trends at annual scale; localized or sub-annual anomalies are possible but not resolved in this dataset.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Continue to plan wind capacity expansion under the assumption of stable wind climatology, but supplement with site-specific, high-frequency wind assessments.\n2. Monitor new observational datasets and higher-resolution modeling to detect potential emerging trends in extreme low-wind events.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Calm days\" are days with surface wind speed under 2 meters per second (m/s), a threshold well below what is needed for practical wind turbine generation.\n- CMIP6 HighResMIP is a large climate model dataset; \"ensemble mean\" means the average result across several models, which is used to filter out random weather fluctuations and focus on broad trends.",
