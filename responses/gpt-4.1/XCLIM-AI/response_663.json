  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the implications of changing wind directions for off-shore wind energy projects in Casablanca, Morocco throughout 2020-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nWind speed extremes for Casablanca show a modest decrease toward mid-century, which may slightly reduce the risk and variability for off-shore wind energy projects, though no drastic change in overall wind regime is projected.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAnalysis of the CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble mean for Casablanca reveals that annual maximum near-surface wind speeds (a proxy for wind event intensity and sectoral design risk) decline slightly from a mean of 40.5 m/s (2021–2035) to 38.0 m/s (2036–2050). The minimum annual daily maxima remain stable at ~6.2–6.4 m/s. No evidence of pronounced or abrupt changes in wind extremes is seen, implying that wind energy resource and structural design risks should remain stable, though site-specific wind directionality is not resolved by these indicators. Risk of catastrophic wind events gradually lessens, thereby reducing operational uncertainty for off-shore wind projects under SSP5-8.5.  \nAll values: CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                     | Evidence supporting the statement               | Source                                                        | Type      | \n|---|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| 1 | Maximum annual wind speeds show slow decline  | Mean max sfcWindmax: 40.5 m/s (2021–35), 38.0 m/s (2036–50) | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (SSP5-8.5)         | numeric   |\n| 2 | Minimum annual wind maxima remain stable      | Mean min sfcWindmax: 6.2 m/s (2021–35), 6.4 m/s (2036–50)   | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (SSP5-8.5)         | numeric   |\n| 3 | No evidence for abrupt wind regime changes    | Model trends non-significant; std dev ~2.1 m/s  | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (SSP5-8.5)         | numeric   |\n| 4 | Directional wind data not resolved in this set| Derived indicators track magnitude, not direction | N/A                                                          | text      |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on SSP5-8.5, using 7-model HighResMIP CMIP6 mean.\n- Data limitations: Only wind speed magnitude is available, not direction; near-surface, not hub height.\n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence for wind speed trend; low confidence for directionality and fine-scale variability.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Supplement ensemble mean speed data with high-resolution, site-specific wind direction analysis for micro-siting and turbine orientation.\n2. Maintain existing structural design standards, but periodically reassess wind hazard as new climate projections and local measurements become available.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “sfcWindmax” refers to the modeled daily maximum wind speed at near-surface level.\n- “Ensemble mean” is the average result across seven climate models; “SSP5-8.5” is a high-emissions future scenario.\n- This report does not cover wind direction, only speed extremes relevant to structural and yield risk.",
