  "QuestionText": "What is the potential economic loss for the French wine industry from a projected increase in the frequency of severe spring frost events in the Burgundy region by 2030?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\n\nBased on CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean projections for the Burgundy region (latitude 47.322, longitude 4.8384), the timing of the last spring frost is expected to continue exhibiting substantial interannual variability but gradually advance earlier in the year by 2030. The annual number of frost days is projected to decrease moderately over the coming decade. However, there is no quantitative evidence—at the analyzed ensemble mean level—of a statistically significant increase in the frequency of severe spring frost events by 2030.  \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The number of frost-affected days is projected to decline, with the mean last spring frost date shifting earlier, reducing overall frost risk to vineyards.\n- The absence of a projected increase in frost events implies that economic losses specifically from severe spring frosts are unlikely to rise by 2030, according to current CMIP6 model ensemble averages.\n- These results, derived from peer-reviewed climate scenarios, provide a robust basis for local risk management and adaptive planning for viticulture in Burgundy.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | The mean date of last spring frost (1981–2020): day 92.4 (std 6.7); projected for 2021–2035: day 84.6 (std 6.1) | Multi-model mean last_spring_frost indicator | CMIP6 HighResMIP (7 models), hist‑1950/highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5 |\n| 2 | Mean annual frost days drop from 54.2 (std 7.2) in 1981–2020 to 43.9 (std 4.4) in 2021–2035 | Multi-model mean frost_days indicator | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble (7 models) |\n| 3 | Trend in both indicators is negative (earlier frosts, fewer frost days); no significant increase observed for spring frost frequency | Trend statistics; p-values show no robust increase | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model results |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Data are derived from a peer-reviewed, multi-model climate experiment (CMIP6 HighResMIP), representing forced signal projections of temperature extremes. Results are robust at the statistical ensemble mean level but may not resolve local microclimate extremes.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \n\nWhile the ensemble mean scenario shows a reduction in overall frost risk and no clear increase in spring frost frequency by 2030, there are important uncertainties. The CMIP6 HighResMIP ensemble is designed to represent the forced climate signal and may not capture extreme, localized cold events (which often drive severe economic losses in viticulture). Additionally, economic losses depend not just on frost climatology, but also on vine phenology, crop insurance, protective measures, and the price/yield response to frost damage. Thus, while the models do not project increased physical frost risk, rare damaging frost events—even if less frequent—can still cause large economic impacts in individual years. Stakeholders should continue to monitor both seasonal forecasts and vineyard-level data.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Continue investment in frost protection and adaptive vineyard practices, as rare damaging events remain possible even with declining mean risk.\n2. Utilize targeted seasonal climate forecasts and local monitoring to manage acute risk in sensitive spring periods, adjusting practices as new information becomes available.\n\n---",
