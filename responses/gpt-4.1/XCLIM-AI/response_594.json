  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  How might a shorter, warmer winter affect the business interruption insurance claims for ski resorts in the French Alps over the next decade?. \n\n Do not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n---\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nA shorter, warmer winter is likely to increase business interruption insurance claims for French Alps ski resorts over the next decade due to reduced frost season length and fewer extreme cold days.\n\n---\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate model projections for the Les Allues, French Alps region (45.92°N, 6.42°E) under a high-emission scenario indicate a marked reduction in frost season length, dropping from a 1981–2020 mean of 163.6 days to 151.1 days for 2021–2035, with continued decline expected. Similarly, days with minimum temperature below –10°C decrease from an average of 25.8 to 19.9 per year in the same interval. These changes imply shorter, less reliable ski seasons, elevating operational and revenue risks and making business interruption insurance claims more frequent and volatile. The insurance sector and resorts must anticipate higher claims frequency as a result of ongoing winter warming.  \nAll values: CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5).\n\n---\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | The frost season length is projected to decrease by ~12.5 days in 2021–2035 vs. 1981–2020 | Mean frost season length: 163.6 days (1981–2020) → 151.1 days (2021–2035); std dev: 12.7/12.2 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 2 | Days with minimum temperature below –10°C decrease substantially | Mean: 25.8 days (1981–2020) → 19.9 days (2021–2035); std dev: 4.9/3.7 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n| 3 | Downward trends continue into 2036–2050 | Mean frost season length: 144.0 days; days below –10°C: 16.1 | CMIP6 HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean (7 models, hist‑1950 / highres‑future, SSP5‑8.5) | numeric |\n\n---\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: High-emission (SSP5‑8.5) only; model ensemble mean used; local microclimate not resolved.\n- Data limitations: Only large region, model mean—does not capture local snowmaking, altitude effects, or climate adaptation.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction of change; uncertainty remains in absolute magnitude for any single location/year.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Update insurance risk models to account for 8–24 fewer frost-season days and 6–10 fewer severe cold days per year in the 2020s–2040s.\n2. Consider premium adjustments, seasonal coverage modifications, and incentivizing climate adaptation (e.g., snowmaking, diversification) for ski resorts.\n\n---\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Frost season length\": Number of consecutive days with minimum temperature below 0°C.\n- \"Days below –10°C\": Proxy for severe winter cold; fewer such days imply milder winters, less natural snow reliability. \n\n---",
