  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the projected impact of climate change on energy infrastructure resilience in coastal Louisiana, USA, over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change will significantly heighten risks to energy infrastructure resilience in coastal Louisiana by increasing exposure to heat, flooding, storms, and sea level rise over the next 20 years.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nIn the coming two decades, energy infrastructure in coastal Louisiana will face increasing threats from climate change, with mean summer temperatures projected to rise above 37°C, accompanied by more intense hurricanes and higher flood risks driven by a projected sea level rise of 14–18 inches by 2050. The region’s low-lying and marshy landscape, already prone to flooding, will become more susceptible to storm surge, saline intrusion, and heat-related stress, increasing the risk of outages and physical damage to power generation, transmission, and storage. To protect reliability, infrastructure designs must adapt to withstand more severe heat, stronger winds, and chronic inundation. Taking proactive measures to harden and adapt energy systems presents critical opportunities for resilience.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Mean summer temperatures projected to exceed 37°C by 2040s | August mean: 35.97°C (2020s) → 37.56°C (2040s) | Dataset (climate model output) | numeric |\n| 2 | Sea level along the Gulf Coast to rise 14–18 inches by 2050 | “14–18 inches by 2050 for Gulf Coast” | Wikipedia (NOAA cited) | citation |\n| 3 | Intensification of storms/hurricanes will worsen wind and surge hazards | Qualitative increase in hurricane strength for Gulf Coast | Wikipedia | text |\n| 4 | Record increase in billion-dollar climate disasters affecting infrastructure | 27 such disasters in the U.S. in 2024 | Wikipedia | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Regional temperature/precipitation figures are model means; local wind/sea level surge specifics extrapolated from U.S. Gulf regional projections rather than site-scale.  \n- Data limitations: No direct, local wind/surge model outputs for Avoyelles Parish; lack of detailed site-by-site infrastructure vulnerability data.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence regarding rising temperatures, general flood/sea level trends, and increased storm impact; moderate confidence for local specifics due to limited granular data.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Retrofit or elevate substations, transmission lines, and fuel storage in known floodplains and low-lying areas; implement heat and corrosion-resistant design.  \n2. Update resilience planning by integrating the most recent climate projections (temperature, precipitation, storm frequency, sea level rise) into infrastructure siting, operations, and backup/emergency protocols.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Sea level rise” means the long-term upward trend in ocean height, which increases the likelihood of coastal flooding.  \n- “Resilience” is the infrastructure’s ability to maintain function or recover quickly from extreme weather, such as heatwaves, floods, or hurricanes.",
