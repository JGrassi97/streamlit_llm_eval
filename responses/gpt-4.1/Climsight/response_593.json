  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n What is the expected impact of rising temperatures on the financial viability of cattle farming operations in Queensland, Australia, due to increased costs for water and feed by 2040?. \n\n Do not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures and variable rainfall by 2040 are projected to increase water and feed costs for cattle farming in Queensland, threatening financial viability due to heat stress and suboptimal pasture conditions.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, cattle farming in Kilcummin, Queensland is expected to face higher input costs from both increased water demand and reduced pasture productivity. Monthly mean temperatures in the 2040s frequently exceed the optimal maximum for common pasture grass (27°C), and mean annual precipitation remains marginal or below the optimal threshold (500–1300 mm/year). This will likely lower pasture yields, necessitating more purchased feed and supplemental water, amplifying production costs. Elevated heat and water stress may suppress cattle productivity, leading to increased risk of financial losses for farming operations unless adaptation measures are implemented.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Projected monthly mean temperatures 2040–2049 frequently exceed 27°C, above optimal for Poa pratensis | Jan: 29.6°C, Feb: 29.4°C, Mar: 30.1°C, Apr: 28.6°C | ClimSight dataset retrieved via get_data_components | numeric |\n| 2 | Mean annual precipitation hovers near or below optimal pasture requirement (500–1300mm) | 2040s annual precipitation sum ≈ 505mm, driest months << optimal | ClimSight dataset retrieved via get_data_components | numeric |\n| 3 | Common pasture grass optimal limits: min rainfall 500 mm/year, optimal max temp 27°C | ECOCROP database, Poa pratensis profile | numeric/text |\n| 4 | Feed and water costs expected to rise with heat and pasture deficits | No direct regional economics, but RAG search confirms link | RAG search (summary) | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on one set of climate projections; alternative climate scenarios may show different trends  \n- Data limitations: Lack of direct cost data; regional climate projections may have inherent uncertainty  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence that increased temperatures and decreased rainfall raise water/feed requirements, but magnitude of financial impact is uncertain\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in heat- and drought-tolerant pasture species suitable for Queensland’s future climate.  \n2. Develop on-farm water capture and storage strategies to buffer against rainfall variability and increased cattle water needs.  \n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Optimal means ideal or most favorable values for pasture growth (temperature/rainfall)  \n- “Poa pratensis” refers to a common grass used in pastures",
