  "QuestionText": "How might a shorter, warmer winter affect the business interruption insurance claims for ski resorts in the French Alps over the next decade?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n How might a shorter, warmer winter affect the business interruption insurance claims for ski resorts in the French Alps over the next decade?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nA shorter, warmer winter is likely to increase business interruption insurance claims for ski resorts due to more frequent operational closures and reduced snow reliability.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected warming trends in the French Alps (Saint-Jean-de-Sixt) show winter months with temperatures increasingly near or above freezing, especially in December and March, alongside erratic precipitation. These climatic shifts undermine snow reliability, leading to more frequent and earlier ski season disruptions. Reduced snow cover and unpredictable weather heighten operational risks for resorts, resulting in a probable rise in insurance claims tied to business interruptions. Insurers face growing financial exposure from increased claims frequency, especially over the next two decades as the warming trend accelerates, pointing to higher premiums or stricter policy terms for resort operators.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Winter temperatures are projected to rise, with December–March seeing a trend toward and above 0°C. | For 2040–2049, December avg. 4.15°C, January –0.42°C, February –1.11°C, March –1.62°C. | get_data_components | numeric |\n| 2 | Winter precipitation is variable, with notable reductions in some months, affecting snow reliability. | 2040–2049: December drops to 120.93mm, March to 122.48mm, September as low as 40.19mm. | get_data_components | numeric |\n| 3 | Increased operational risks and closures are linked to warm, snow-scarce winters. | Knowledge base: Shorter/warmer winters increase business interruption claims at ski resorts. | RAG_search | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Data limited to mid-century monthly temperature/precipitation averages; snowmaking or adaptation not included.  \n- Data limitations: Direct snow cover, ski day loss, or claims numbers unavailable; based on temperature, precipitation, and knowledge base.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trend direction (warmer winters, more risk), but low confidence in quantitative claim frequency.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Ski resorts and insurers should reassess insurance terms to reflect increased climate risk, incorporating climate projections into contracts.  \n2. Resorts should invest in adaptation strategies (e.g., snowmaking, diversified activities) to mitigate business interruption risks.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Business interruption insurance\" covers financial loss from forced closure or operational stoppage.  \n- Temperature and precipitation values are monthly averages: higher temperatures and lower precipitation indicate less snow.",
