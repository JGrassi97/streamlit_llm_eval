  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of rising average temperatures and subsequent increased air conditioning load on the efficiency of solar farms in the Atacama Desert, Chile, by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nA rise in average temperatures by 0.8–1.5°C by 2035 is expected to decrease solar panel efficiency by 0.3–0.8%, while higher air conditioning loads will shift peak electricity demand to the hottest times, possibly reducing net exportable solar output.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2035, the Atacama Desert will experience an increase in monthly average temperatures of 0.8–1.5°C compared to the 2020s. This warming will modestly reduce the energy conversion efficiency of typical silicon solar panels by roughly 0.3–0.8% due to their negative temperature coefficient (about 0.4–0.5% per °C rise). While solar irradiance remains among the world’s highest and precipitation remains negligible, growing air conditioning demand during heatwaves will create new peaks in local electricity usage, particularly aligning with periods of maximum solar generation. The combined effect is a slight reduction in efficiency and a potential decrease in solar-generated electricity available for export during the hottest periods, though the Atacama remains highly favorable for solar PV overall.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Projected temperature increase by 2035 is 0.8–1.5°C | Data shows monthly mean temperature rises of 0.82–1.6°C from 2020–2029 to 2030–2039 | Regional climate projection data | numeric |\n| 2 | Solar panel efficiency decreases by 0.4–0.5% per °C | Solar cell output drops ~0.4–0.5% per °C; 0.8–1.5°C rise yields a 0.3–0.8% efficiency loss | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell | citation |\n| 3 | Precipitation remains extremely low (<20 mm/month) | Monthly precipitation projections confirm arid conditions | Regional climate dataset | numeric |\n| 4 | Increased temperatures drive higher AC demand, shifting net load | Expert knowledge: Electricity demand for cooling rises, changing peak timing | Internal knowledge/context | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis uses one regional climate simulation; actual emissions and economic development may differ.  \n- Data limitations: Lack of precise projections for local AC load growth and specific solar panel technologies to be deployed.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction and range of temperature effect on panel efficiency; moderate confidence about demand dynamics.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Select or retrofit solar panels with lower temperature coefficients and/or improved panel ventilation to minimize temperature-related efficiency losses.  \n2. Coordinate with grid operators to manage coincident peaks of solar production and local air conditioning demand (e.g., energy storage, demand-response programs).\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Temperature coefficient” refers to the percentage decrease in a solar panel’s energy output for each degree (°C) of temperature increase above standard test conditions.\n- “Net output” means the electricity available from the solar farm after meeting local use (like air conditioning), which is the amount that can be sent to the grid or sold elsewhere.",
