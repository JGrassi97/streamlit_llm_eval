  "QuestionText": "In what ways could shifts in precipitation impact the prevalence of waterborne diseases in Khartoum, Sudan (15.5007N, 32.5599E) through to 2030?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nShifts in precipitation in Khartoum, Sudan, through to 2030 are expected to alter the prevalence and outbreak patterns of waterborne diseases. Projected patterns show a highly seasonal rainfall regime, with almost all precipitation occurring from June to October, peaking in August and September at up to 18–26 mm/month. These spikes in rainfall increase the risk of flooding and subsequent contamination of water supplies, which are key drivers of outbreaks for diseases such as cholera and various diarrheal illnesses. Conversely, prolonged dry periods can also increase disease risk by forcing communities to use inadequate or unsafe water sources. The region’s population growth and existing infrastructural challenges amplify these vulnerabilities.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Khartoum’s wet season rainfall is projected to intensify slightly in key months, raising the likelihood of flood-driven contamination while long dry stretches heighten dependence on potentially unsafe water.  \n- Both excess rainfall and drought are directly linked to increased waterborne disease risk, especially where healthcare and sanitation infrastructure are already under severe pressure.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Heavy rainfall increases waterborne disease risk | Studies and reviews consistently link flooding to diarrheal disease outbreaks | Wikipedia (Climate change and infectious diseases) |\n| 2 | Khartoum’s wet season will see monthly rainfall of up to 26 mm | Climate simulation data for 2030–39 | Provided precipitation dataset |\n| 3 | Dry periods also increase waterborne disease risk due to reliance on unsafe sources | Literature review and climate-health syntheses | Wikipedia, RAG search |\n| 4 | Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of child mortality in Africa | Health statistics and literature | Wikipedia, global health data summaries |\n| 5 | Population growth will stress existing WASH infrastructure | Projected population for 2030 increases to over 51 million in Sudan | Sudan population dataset |\n| 6 | Khartoum’s infrastructure has limited resilience to flooding | No direct local assessment in data, but regional reviews report high vulnerability | RAG search, synthesized reviews |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Precipitation and temperature projections come from model-based datasets.\n- Health and population claims are supported by literature and expert-reviewed summaries, with broad scientific consensus.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile model projections reliably capture the general seasonality and broad magnitude of rainfall shifts, there is notable uncertainty in how extreme events (such as intense storms or prolonged droughts) will manifest at the hyper-local scale of Khartoum. The impact on waterborne disease prevalence will also depend on factors outside the scope of climatic data, such as effectiveness of local public health interventions, upgrades in water and sanitation infrastructure, and how population growth is managed. The evidence from global and regional studies is highly relevant but cannot specify precise outbreak magnitudes or timing for Khartoum beyond establishing clear risk relationships.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Prepare and enhance public health monitoring and disease response capacity each year during the peak rainfall months (particularly July to October) to quickly detect and respond to outbreaks.  \n2. Prioritize investment in flood-proof, climate-resilient water supply and sanitation (WASH) infrastructure—including safe water storage, improved drainage, and emergency water disinfection resources—to minimize the risks from both wet- and dry-season hazards.  \n\n---",
