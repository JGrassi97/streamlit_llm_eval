  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n What are the systemic financial risks that climate change poses to the agricultural lending portfolios of banks in the US Midwest?. \n\n Do not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change increases systemic financial risk for agricultural lending portfolios in the US Midwest through more frequent drought, heat stress, and crop yield variability, raising loan default risk and stressing banks’ rural asset quality.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBanks lending to Midwest agriculture, with portfolios concentrated in corn and soybean, face systemic risk from climate change. Projected rising summer temperatures (up to 30°C or more by 2040–2049) and declining peak-season precipitation (August–September below 7 mm/month) threaten crop yields, especially as optimal rainfall and temperature windows narrow. Such chronic and acute physical risks could impair farmers’ repayment abilities, raising default rates and reducing land values—the main collateral—resulting in declining asset quality and profitability for lenders. Sustained climate volatility could also reduce lending appetite or require higher risk premiums, impacting regional economies.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Summer temperatures projected to exceed crop optima | Mean July–September temperatures reach 26–30°C by 2040–2049 | get_data_components | numeric |\n| 2 | August-September precipitation drops below crop needs | August precipitation projected at 2–7 mm/month by 2040–2049 | get_data_components | numeric |\n| 3 | Corn and soybean viability tied to specific thresholds | Corn needs 600–1200 mm/year, 18–33°C; soybean 600–1500 mm/year, 20–33°C | ECOCROP database | numeric |\n| 4 | Literature links heat/drought to higher default risk | No documents found directly, but projected conditions misalign with crop needs | RAG_search, Wikipedia | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Only one set of projections analyzed; other models may differ.  \n- Data limitations: Lack of direct yield or financial loss projections; limited precise drought/failure frequency estimates.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in directional risk (higher temperature, lower rain), moderate in specific portfolio loss quantification.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Diversify agricultural lending portfolios with climate-resilient practices, such as crop insurance and investment in irrigation or drought-resilient seed varieties.\n2. Incorporate forward-looking climate and crop suitability data into credit risk evaluation and stress testing of regional agricultural portfolios.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Systemic risk” means risk that threatens the whole system (in this case, agricultural finance), not just individual loans.\n- Crop “viability thresholds” refer to the range of temperature and rainfall in which crops can reliably grow and produce profitable yields.
