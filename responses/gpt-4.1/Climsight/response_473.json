  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n What is the projected change in solar panel energy output during summer months in Seville, Spain, due to higher average temperatures between 2030 and 2040? \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nSolar panel output in Seville is projected to decrease very slightly (less than 0.2%) during summer months in 2030–2040 due to minimal changes or even minor decreases in mean summer temperatures.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected mean summer temperatures in Seville between 2030 and 2040 show negligible change compared to the 2020–2029 period (e.g., June: 18.6°C to 18.5°C, July: 22.4°C to 21.9°C, August: 25.6°C to 25.5°C). Since solar panel output typically declines by about 0.4–0.5% per °C increase, this small temperature difference will have a minimal and likely negligible negative effect on energy yield. Wind and precipitation patterns in summer remain stable and do not present additional risks. No significant risk or opportunity is expected for solar power productivity in this timeframe due to temperature changes.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                          | Evidence supporting the statement                                 | Source                                      | Type      |\n|---|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| 1 | Mean summer temperatures show little/no increase    | June: 18.6→18.5°C, July: 22.4→21.9°C, August: 25.6→25.5°C (2030s) | Climatic dataset for Seville, Spain         | numeric   |\n| 2 | Output declines ~0.4–0.5% per each 1°C rise        | Efficiency loss (βPmax: -0.4%/°C for crystalline silicon panels)  | Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel | citation  |\n| 3 | Minimal projected output loss                      | Loss < 0.2% for <0.5°C temp difference in summer months           | Calculation based on retrieved data         | numeric   |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes continued trends and emissions scenario used in dataset  \n- Data limitations: Specific panel type/site characteristics not included; uses mean temperature, not module temperature  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in minimal impact due to small projected temperature change\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Maintain current solar installation plans; no adaptation is required for projected temperature change.  \n2. Monitor for any site-specific microclimate effects that could affect panel temperature more than ambient trends.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Temperature coefficient” is how much solar panel electricity drops per degree C that the panel gets hotter.  \n- “Mean summer temperature” is the average air temperature for June, July, and August. \n\n",
