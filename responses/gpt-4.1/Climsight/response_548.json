  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the key public health planning considerations related to climate change for cities in the Great Lakes region of North America?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nCities must plan for rising extreme heat, more intense rainfall and floods, poorer air/water quality, and increased vulnerability of at-risk populations.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nPublic health planning for Great Lakes cities like Chicago must address the increased risk of heatwaves, intensified rainfall and urban flooding, and the resulting adverse impacts on air and water quality. Monthly data show summer temperatures rising into the upper 20s °C by the 2040s, and spring rainfall peaking over 50 mm/month, while late summer may become drier—raising risks of both acute heat stress and water stress. Vulnerable groups (elderly, children, low-income) are at heightened risk due to these climatic shifts and urban heat island effects. Timely adaptation measures such as urban cooling strategies, emergency heat protocols, and stormwater upgrades are essential to reduce mortality, illness, and health disparities.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Extreme heat risk is growing, especially in summer months | July and August mean temperatures projected to reach 26–30°C by 2040s; urban areas see heat island effect | ClimSight dataset, Wikipedia: Effects of climate change on human health | Numeric / Citation |\n| 2 | Flooding and water quality issues are increasing due to precipitation shifts | May and June precipitation rising to 53 mm/month by 2040s; noted increase in heavy rain events and surface flooding risk | ClimSight dataset, Wikipedia | Numeric / Citation |\n| 3 | Vulnerable populations are most at risk from climate impacts | Health effects include increased hospitalizations, mortality among elderly, children, and those with chronic illness | Wikipedia: Effects of climate change on human health | Citation |\n| 4 | Urban air quality and water infrastructure are threatened by changing climate and storm patterns | More frequent floods and heatwaves increase air pollution and risk of contaminated water supplies | Wikipedia | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Moderate emissions pathway assumed; local variations possible  \n- Data limitations: Projections based on available decadal averages; localized extremes may be underrepresented  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in trends for extreme heat and more intense precipitation events; medium confidence in exact month-to-month projections\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Expand public cooling centers, green infrastructure, and urban vegetation to mitigate urban heat  \n2. Upgrade stormwater and drinking water systems to manage flooding and safeguard water quality  \n3. Prioritize health interventions for elderly, children, and low-income residents during extreme weather  \n4. Develop comprehensive emergency response plans for heatwaves, floods, and outbreaks of climate-sensitive diseases\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Urban heat island effect\": Cities are often warmer than nearby rural areas due to concrete and buildings trapping heat  \n- \"Vulnerable groups\": People who face higher risk of health impacts, such as seniors, children, and low-income individuals",
