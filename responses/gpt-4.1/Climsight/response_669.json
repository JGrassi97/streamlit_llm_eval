  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat impact might expected temperature changes have on energy demand in Cairo, Egypt over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures in Cairo will substantially increase energy demand for cooling, especially during the hotter summers expected over the next two decades.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nMean monthly temperatures in Cairo are projected to rise, with July and August means increasing by about 2°C from the 2020s to the 2040s. This ongoing warming will significantly boost energy demand for cooling (e.g., air conditioning) during already hot summers, while milder winters may slightly reduce heating requirements. The main driver is higher summer temperatures, leading to greater peak loads on electricity infrastructure. Risks include energy shortfalls, increased costs, and stress on the grid during heat waves. Strategic adaptation, such as efficiency improvements and demand response, will be essential to manage these challenges.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Summer temperatures will rise by about 2°C by the 2040s | July: 31.36°C (2020s) to 33.26°C (2040s); August: 33.21°C to 35.3°C | ClimSight dataset | numeric |\n| 2 | Energy demand correlates linearly with ambient temperature | Wikipedia notes established linear energy signature models | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_signature | citation |\n| 3 | Higher cooling demand will drive increased electricity use | RAG and climate projections confirm more cooling required as summers get hotter | Internal RAG; ClimSight | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on available historical and projection datasets, moderate emissions scenario assumed  \n- Data limitations: No local building energy use or policy change data included; projections may vary with future emissions  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature trend, moderate in precise energy demand outcomes\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Invest in energy-efficient cooling systems and building design to manage higher electricity demand.\n2. Expand and modernize grid infrastructure to accommodate increased peak summer loads.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Cooling degree days” measures how much (and how often) outside air temperature exceeds a certain threshold, increasing cooling needs.\n- “Energy signature” refers to the relationship between temperature and building energy demand.",
