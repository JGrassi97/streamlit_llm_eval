  "QuestionText": "How will a projected decrease in Sierra Nevada snowpack reduce the water allocations from the Central Valley Project for almond growers near Fresno, California, during the summer months by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2040, climate projections indicate a significant decline in Sierra Nevada snowpack, which is expected to sharply reduce Central Valley Project (CVP) water allocations to almond growers near Fresno during the critical summer irrigation period. At the Fresno site, average summer precipitation remains extremely low (June: 16.95mm, July: 2.11mm, August: 0.25mm monthly), while summer temperatures are projected to rise above historical norms (June: 19.0°C, July: 22.6°C, August: 26.3°C), increasing crop water demand. With the Sierra snowpack—a key natural reservoir for California’s water supply—projected to decrease by up to 65% by century’s end (and already showing >25% loss), growers relying on CVP supplies will face increased frequency and severity of cutbacks. Economic risk to almond production is heightened as allocations become less reliable, irrigation deficits increase, and the long-term sustainability of water-intensive crops like almonds in Fresno is brought into question.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Directly connects declining snowpack to summer water shortages for Fresno-area almond growers reliant on CVP allocations.  \n- Highlights water availability as a limiting factor for crop viability and informs adaptation, risk management, and economic planning decisions for growers, district managers, and policymakers.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Sierra Nevada snowpack projected to decrease 48–65% by 2100, with historic mid-elevation snowpack losses of up to 43%. | 2018 IPCC, 2017 UCLA study as cited in Wikipedia | Wikipedia |\n| 2 | Summer precipitation at Fresno will remain extremely low by 2040 (June–Aug avg: <6.5 mm/month), far below almond optimal rainfall (600–900 mm annual). | Climate model output (2040s), ECOCROP almond profile | ClimSight, ECOCROP |\n| 3 | Summer temperatures are rising (June: +0.53°C, July: +0.55°C, August: +1.15°C above baseline by 2040), increasing crop water demand. | Model projections (2020s vs 2040s) | ClimSight dataset |\n| 4 | CVP allocations are expected to become more erratic and reduced in drought years as snowpack is lost. | Expert/governmental policy summaries | Wikipedia, California DWR |\n| 5 | Majority of California’s summer irrigation supply depends on Sierra snowmelt—not local rainfall. | Water cycle explanation and DWR estimates | Wikipedia |\n| 6 | Almonds require high annual rainfall (600–900mm) or equivalent irrigation, which is no longer assured by CVP allocations under declining snowpack. | ECOCROP agronomic database | ECOCROP |\n| 7 | No local natural hazards listed (e.g., floods/droughts), but hydrologic drought risk is implied through snowpack loss. | Empty natural hazard dataset | Provided data |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Sources are based on peer-reviewed research (IPCC, academic studies), official state/federal agency outputs (California Department of Water Resources), rigorously curated climate models (nextGEMS/ClimSight), and expert agronomic databases (ECOCROP).\n- The information is synthesized from authoritative, expert-reviewed repositories; anecdotal or speculative statements have been excluded.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile the overall trend toward diminished snowpack and reduced summer CVP allocations is robust, precise annual water delivery figures for 2040 remain uncertain due to operational, legal, and climatic variables. Interannual variability (e.g., wet El Niño years or extreme droughts) could mitigate or aggravate shortfalls in any given year. Projected temperature and precipitation figures, based on multi-model means, could be influenced by unforeseen technological advances, conservation policies, or regional hydrologic interventions. However, the convergence between multiple climate models, peer-reviewed studies, and crop requirements allows high confidence in the directionality and significance of the risk.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Almond growers in the Fresno region should invest in advanced irrigation management, water efficiency improvements, and drought-adaptive practices, while seeking diversification or contingency arrangements for water sourcing to reduce reliance on the increasingly variable CVP supplies.  \n2. Regional water and agricultural policy planners should prioritize development and support of water-efficient crop systems, incentivize adoption of orchard water-saving technologies, and update allocation frameworks to reflect the new hydrologic reality by 2040.\n\n---",
