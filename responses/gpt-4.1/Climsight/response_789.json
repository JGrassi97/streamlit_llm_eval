  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will climate change affect the long-term risk projections for infrastructure investments in Agadir, Morocco by 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2050, rising heat, persistent drought, and stronger winds will substantially increase risks to infrastructure investments in Agadir, especially for energy, water, and urban systems.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjections for Agadir indicate that, by 2050, mean summer temperatures will regularly exceed 35°C and peak near 38°C, while annual precipitation will remain extremely low (<3 mm/month), intensifying drought conditions. Winds are expected to strengthen and fluctuate more, posing added risk to structures. These climatic changes will raise cooling and water demand, stress electrical and water grids, and potentially cause structural wear from heat and wind. Infrastructure not adapted for these extremes faces increased maintenance costs and operational disruptions. However, strengthening building codes for heat and wind, prioritizing water-saving systems, and climate-informed urban design can protect long-term investments and urban resilience.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Mean summer temperatures expected to rise beyond 38°C by 2049 | August mean: 36.4°C (2020s), 37.5–38.0°C (2040s) | Provided climate projections | numeric |\n| 2 | Rainfall projected to remain extremely low, deepening droughts | Summer precipitation consistently <1 mm/month through 2049 | Provided climate projections | numeric |\n| 3 | Higher urban and infrastructure vulnerability due to heat/drought | IPCC, Wikipedia: Cities face rising heatwaves, drought, infrastructure stress; adaptation needed | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_adaptation | citation |\n| 4 | Winds expected to strengthen in certain months, increasing stress | Wind speeds up to 3.3 m/s (Feb. 2040s vs 2.3 m/s in 2020s) | Provided climate projections | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections based on current emissions scenarios and available 2020–2049 model simulation outputs  \n- Data limitations: No detailed local records of extreme weather events, sector-specific vulnerabilities, or adaptation interventions  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in continued warming and drying trends; moderate confidence in wind hazard increases\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Update and enforce infrastructure design standards for extreme heat, drought, and stronger winds (e.g., cooling, insulation, wind resistance).  \n2. Invest in water-saving technologies, resilient cooling systems, and adaptive urban planning to mitigate climate impacts on essential infrastructure.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Mean\": the average value over time; \"mm/month\": millimeters of rain per month; \"wind speed\": how fast the wind blows.  \n- \"Urban heat island\": city areas getting much hotter than surrounding regions, due to buildings absorbing heat.  \n- \"IPCC\": Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, authoritative group on climate science.\n",
