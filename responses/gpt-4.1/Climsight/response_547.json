  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might climate change influence the burden of disease in Central Asian nations over the next 20 to 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change is projected to increase the burden of vector-borne and waterborne diseases in Central Asia, especially during hotter months, due to rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next 20–30 years, Central Asia, including Tashkent, will likely experience higher mean temperatures (up to 36°C in summer by 2049) and altered precipitation, with drier summers and increased variability over winters and springs. These changes are expected to expand the range and seasonality of vector-borne diseases (such as malaria, dengue, and leishmaniasis), while more extreme rainfall and flooding may amplify waterborne and diarrheal disease risk. Climate hazards may also impact food and water security, increasing vulnerability. The impact will be seasonal: high disease risk aligns with warmer, wetter conditions from spring to autumn, demanding vigilant health surveillance and adaptation measures.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Summer mean temperatures may reach up to 36°C by 2049 | Projected monthly mean temperature for July/August: up to 36.06°C | ClimSight climate dataset | numeric |\n| 2 | Hotter, longer summers expand vector-borne disease risk | Higher temps enable mosquito/tick survival, increasing malaria/dengue risk | Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_and_infectious_diseases | citation |\n| 3 | Waterborne disease outbreaks linked to heavy rainfall/flooding | Climate-driven precipitation extremes increase diarrheal disease risk | Wikipedia source, ClimSight climate dataset | citation/text |\n| 4 | Central Asia’s dry summer conditions may limit some disease vectors, but spring/fall risks rise | July–Sept precipitation <1 mm/month, but winter–spring remains moderate | ClimSight climate dataset | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on mid-range emission and regional climate model scenarios  \n- Data limitations: No local disease incidence or specific health impact projections; limited region-specific climate-health research  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature projections; moderate confidence in specific disease outcomes due to multiple interacting factors\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Strengthen disease vector and water quality surveillance, especially during warmer seasons and after heavy rains.  \n2. Implement adaptive public health strategies (e.g., urban cooling, water management, early warning for outbreaks).\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Vector-borne disease\": Illnesses spread by insects such as mosquitoes or ticks (e.g., malaria, dengue, leishmaniasis)  \n- \"Waterborne disease\": Illnesses from contaminated water (e.g., diarrhea, cholera)  \n",
