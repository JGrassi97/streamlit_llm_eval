  "QuestionText": "How will future climate conditions alter the market risks for globally traded commodities like coffee and cocoa?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nFuture climate projections for Medellín, Colombia, indicate that monthly average temperatures could rise to 31–32°C by the 2040s, with highly variable rainfall including summer peaks above 100 mm/month. As these changes nudge the local climate outside the optimal ranges for coffee (best at 14–28°C) and the upper limits for cocoa (21–32°C), market risks for these globally traded commodities will increase. The key impact is a heightened likelihood of local yield variability, crop stress, and potentially more frequent shortfalls in supply that could drive up global prices and undermine supply chain stability.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Climate-induced heat and unstable rainfall threaten coffee and cocoa yields in one of the world’s key origins, heightening the risk of supply shocks and influencing global commodity markets.\n- This matters because increased crop failure or reduced reliability from Colombia could lead to price spikes, disrupt contracts, and incentivize supply chain shifts that affect not only local farmers but also roasters and manufacturers worldwide.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Medellín’s mean monthly temperatures could reach 31–32°C by 2040–2049; rainfall will remain seasonal but increasingly variable, with peaks >100 mm/month in some months. | Detailed climate model data for 2020–2049 | Internal dataset |\n| 2 | Coffee’s optimum temperature is 14–28°C, and cocoa’s is 21–32°C, with specific rainfall needs (coffee: 1400–2300 mm; cocoa: 1200–3000 mm per year). | ECOCROP database, crop environmental requirements | ECOCROP |\n| 3 | Rising temperatures and unstable rainfall challenge suitability for legacy cocoa and coffee regions, driving risk of yield decline. | International Center for Tropical Agriculture, Wikipedia-cited studies | Wikipedia, cited CIAT research |\n| 4 | High rainfall & heat can decrease soil quality, reduce yields, and increase disease; adaptation with shade and agroforestry recommended. | Wikipedia summary, best practice guidance | Wikipedia |\n| 5 | Adaptation responses (e.g., agroforestry, irrigation) can partially mitigate climate impact on crops. | Wikipedia, cited agroforestry studies | Wikipedia |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Climate data is from model-based projections.\n- Crop requirement data comes from the peer-reviewed ECOCROP database.\n- Wikipedia references rely on expert agency and peer-reviewed studies.\n- Where data is not direct, summary claims are supported by cited research and institutional reports.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThere is moderate uncertainty in this analysis due to the underlying assumptions in climate models and year-to-year weather variation. Projections are robust about temperature direction (+0.5–1.4°C rises by 2040s depending on month) but the magnitude and timing of rainfall changes are less certain, especially regarding drought intensity or seasonal shifts. The ability of farmers and supply chains to adapt, through improved techniques or shifting cultivation zones, adds further socio-economic uncertainty. Exact rainfall totals for annual evaluation versus crop demand are not directly available in the dataset, making local viability assessments somewhat imprecise.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Farmers, cooperatives, and coffee/cocoa buyers should plan for increased seasonal yield variability and potential declines by diversifying origin portfolios, supporting adaptation programs (agroforestry, irrigation), and investing in local monitoring networks.\n2. Policymakers and industry groups should fund climate-resilient crop research and provide incentives for adaptive strategies—such as shade tree planting, soil management, or potentially relocating crops to higher altitudes—to buffer against anticipated climate stresses.\n\n---",
