  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat influence will projected temperature changes have on solar panel efficiency in the Sahara region, Algeria by 2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2050, higher ambient temperatures in the Sahara region are projected to reduce solar panel efficiency by approximately 0.5–1% compared to present, with the largest declines in summer months.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected mean temperature increases of 1–2°C in Tamanghasset, Algeria, by 2050 will negatively impact solar panel efficiency. Solar cells typically lose about 0.45% efficiency per additional 1°C; thus, a 1–2°C warming translates to an annual average efficiency reduction of 0.5–1%. August mean temperatures may exceed 28.5°C (from a current 27.2°C), meaning solar modules will experience even higher cell temperatures, particularly in summer. This will exacerbate efficiency losses when solar irradiation is highest, marginally reducing overall energy yield. Cooling or mitigation solutions may offset some declines, but high summer temperatures will remain a limiting factor.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Each 1°C temperature rise reduces solar panel efficiency by about 0.45% | “An increase in solar cell temperature of approximately 1 °C causes an efficiency decrease of about 0.45%.” | Wikipedia: Solar-cell efficiency | numeric |\n| 2 | Mean monthly temperatures projected to rise 1–2°C by 2040–2049 | Historical (2020s) vs. future (2040s) monthly mean values show 1–2°C increase, e.g., August: 27.21°C → 28.59°C | ClimSight dataset (2020–2049) | numeric |\n| 3 | Summer months (Jul–Sep) will see the largest absolute temperature increases | Projections: July from 26.78°C (2020s) to 28.08°C (2040s) | ClimSight dataset | numeric |\n| 4 | Cell (module) temperature runs higher than ambient, amplifying losses | “Cell temperature, even at 25°C air temperature, is close to 45°C...” | Wikipedia: Solar-cell efficiency | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Climate projections subject to emission scenario used; numbers shown represent multi-decade means.  \n- Data limitations: Actual panel losses depend on exact installation practices, ventilation, module types, and solar irradiance.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction of effect; magnitude may vary by module and mounting.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Integrate module cooling designs or select high-temperature-tolerant solar technologies for future Sahara-based installations.\n2. Optimize installation for airflow and select peak generation strategies during cooler periods when possible.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Solar cell efficiency: the fraction of sunlight converted to electricity, which falls as the device gets hotter.\n- “Ambient temperature” refers to the air temperature around the solar panel.",
