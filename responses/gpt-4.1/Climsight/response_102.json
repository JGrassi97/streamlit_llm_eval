  "QuestionText": "How will hotter conditions affect the post-harvest handling and storage requirements for agricultural products in India over the next two decades?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nIn Wardha district, Maharashtra, India, hotter conditions projected for the next two decades will significantly impact post-harvest handling and storage needs for agricultural products. By the 2040s, peak average temperatures during harvest and early post-harvest periods (April–July) are expected to frequently reach or exceed 40°C, intensifying crop perishability and spoilage risks. This escalation in heat will make rapid post-harvest cooling and reliable cold storage not just beneficial but essential for local producers—especially as research and practical experience highlight that maintaining low temperatures post-harvest is critical to product quality and shelf life. \n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Rising ambient temperatures, especially in late spring and summer, directly threaten the safe storage window for many types of crops, increasing post-harvest losses without intervention.\n- Guidance highlights the urgency for investment in refrigerated storage and improved handling techniques, crucial for producers’ economic sustainability and food security in the region.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Average summer temperatures will approach/exceed 40°C by 2040s | May 2040s: 38.2°C; June 2040s: 40.1°C (monthly means) | Climate model datasets (provided) |\n| 2 | Cool post-harvest handling is vital to prevent spoilage | “Keeping the product cool is one of the most important post-harvest handling goals…” | Wikipedia: Postharvest (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postharvest) |\n| 3 | Hotter conditions increase the need for cold storage | Comparison of projected temperatures vs. storage recommendations | Wikipedia (Postharvest), climate dataset |\n| 4 | Lack of regional/crop-specific storage studies | Data unavailable for India/crops in Ecocrop/internal sources | N/A |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Temperature data: Model-based, sourced from established climate simulations.\n- Storage importance: Wikipedia, based on commonly accepted expert practice; less regionally specific.\n- No directly peer-reviewed, local Indian studies retrieved for post-harvest specifics, so extrapolation is used cautiously.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile the warming trend and its broad implications for spoilage and storage are well-founded, there is moderate uncertainty around the effects for specific crops grown locally and how smaller producers will access or afford new/expanded cooling systems. There is also variability in how severely heat will impact different harvests due to year-to-year fluctuations or monsoon variability. Practical responses may be limited by energy infrastructure and costs, as well as policy support and technology adoption rates.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Prioritize development and subsidization of cold storage facilities and supply chains for April–July, when projected temperatures are highest, with a focus on smallholder access and cost-effective, energy-efficient cooling technologies.\n2. Conduct extension activities and farmer training on rapid post-harvest cooling and improved handling to minimize time from field to storage, leveraging local cooperatives and government support programs.\n\n---",
