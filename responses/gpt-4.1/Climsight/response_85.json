  "QuestionText": "What is the projected impact of climate variability on the outbreaks of locusts in East Africa and the Middle East by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2040, climate variability is forecast to significantly heighten the risk and intensity of locust outbreaks in East Africa and the Middle East, including the Addis Ababa region. Projected conditions at the location—higher mean temperatures (up to 21.2°C in warmest months) and marked shifts in precipitation (with single months like September 2040–2049 receiving up to 393 mm)—will likely generate ideal breeding and swarming environments for desert locusts. Climate models indicate these outbreaks may become more frequent and severe, particularly after cycles of drought followed by intense rain. Persisting winds, coupled with growing population pressures on agriculture, amplify the threat to food security and livelihoods in the region.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- **Direct impact**: Climate changes (especially temperature rise and rainfall variability) will directly boost locust breeding and migration, raising outbreak risk for Ethiopia and beyond.\n- **Societal importance**: Elevated locust activity threatens crops, exacerbates food insecurity, and undermines stability in an area with rapidly increasing population density.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Warmer, wetter weather triggers locust swarms | 2020 East African locust crisis linked to cyclones, rainfall, and temperature rise | Wikipedia; IPCC; Climate change in Africa summaries |\n| 2 | 2040–2049 mean temperatures: 16.9–21.2°C monthly | Modeled decadal climate dataset, Addis Ababa location | ClimSight dataset output |\n| 3 | September and October precipitation may reach ~390 mm/month | Modeled precipitation for 2040–2049 | ClimSight dataset output |\n| 4 | Droughts followed by heavy rain drive breeding | Observed relationship in 2020 invasions | Wikipedia; IPCC Working Group II |\n| 5 | Wind regime supports regional locust migration | Monthly mean wind simulations, 2020–2049 | ClimSight dataset output |\n| 6 | Extreme weather and climate variability drive agricultural pest risk | Peer-reviewed synthesis in IPCC and African climate reports | Wikipedia; IPCC Summary for Policymakers |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Sources are high-quality: IPCC (peer-reviewed/expert-reviewed), validated regional climate models, and reputable encyclopedic evidence documenting recent locust crises. ECOCROP details are plant-based but ecological findings are corroborated by entomological research.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile the broad pattern—more locust outbreaks due to increased temperature and variable rainfall—is robustly supported, there is moderate to high uncertainty in predicting the exact timing, location, and magnitude of future outbreaks. Locust proliferation depends on highly localized weather (especially rainfall), soil moisture, and disease/predation pressures, along with human land use and pest management responses. Climate models provide decadal means and variability but cannot fully resolve these ecological feedbacks. There is also uncertainty regarding national response capacity and cross-border management of swarms.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Bolster national and regional early warning systems, focusing on monitoring climate conditions (rainfall, temperature) and locust habitat, especially in post-drought/post-rainfall periods (August–October).\n2. Enhance local and cross-border rapid response capacity, including community education, field surveillance, and integration of climate forecasts into agricultural and disaster planning to protect food supplies and livelihoods.\n\n---",
