  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n  How do projected climate shifts alter the risk profile for investors in the global coffee market over the next 20 years?.\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreases in temperature and changes in rainfall near Pereira, Colombia, are likely to reduce yield stability, diminish land suitability, and increase price volatility for investors in the global coffee market by 2040.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next two decades in Colombia’s coffee-growing region of Pereira, mean monthly temperatures are projected to move above Coffea arabica’s optimal growing range, while rainfall during critical wet months is expected to decrease and become more erratic. These shifts increase the risk of lower and less predictable yields, more frequent outbreaks of pests and diseases, and shrinking areas suitable for quality arabica cultivation. Investors will face heightened volatility in supply and pricing, along with potentially greater operational and reputational risks linked to production reliability. Strategic adaptation—including diversification, supply chain flexibility, and investment in climate-resilient practices—will be essential to managing these risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Projected temperatures exceed optimal range for arabica coffee | Mean January temp: 29.29°C (2040s); optimal: 14–28°C | ClimSight dataset, ECOCROP database | numeric |\n| 2 | Rainfall declines during peak wet months | July rainfall: 185 mm (2040s) vs 223 mm (2020s) | ClimSight dataset | numeric |\n| 3 | Coffee needs 1400–2300 mm/yr rain, 14–28°C temps (optimal) | ECOCROP database | numeric |\n| 4 | Warming and irregular rainfall increase yield instability and risk of pests/disease | ECOCROP, Wikipedia | text/citation |\n| 5 | Climate-driven crop stress increases price/spread volatility for investors | RAG/Wikipedia summary: climate shocks → market volatility | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on 2020–2049 projections for Pereira; other regions or emissions pathways may yield different results.  \n- Data limitations: Monthly and mean data may overlook short-term extremes (e.g., sudden droughts or floods); results exclude microclimatic, agronomic, or varietal adaptation specifics.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature upward trend; medium confidence in precipitation and market outcome details.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Diversify sourcing to include regions less likely to exceed arabica’s temperature or rainfall tolerances.  \n2. Invest in climate-resilient production systems (e.g., shade, improved varieties, and adaptive agronomy) and work with producers on adaptation strategies.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Optimal” means best for coffee growth and quality; above it, plants suffer heat/pest stress.  \n- “Mean” is average, not maximum/minimum; “precipitation” is total rainfall per month.",
