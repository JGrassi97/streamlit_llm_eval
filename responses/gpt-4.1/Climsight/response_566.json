  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2040, tourism in the national parks of the Western USA, including sites like Yellowstone National Park (near latitude 44.428, longitude -110.5885), is projected to face hotter and drier summers, with mid- to late-summer temperatures regularly reaching 26–30°C and notable drops in rainfall, especially in August (as low as 2.22 mm/month). These conditions are likely to **increase wildfire risks, air quality issues, and discomfort for visitors**, leading to shorter, less predictable tourism seasons and more frequent park disruptions. The overall **profitability and character of tourism in national parks** are set to change, with traditional patterns disrupted by extreme weather, reduced visitor satisfaction, and greater operational burdens.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- **Tourism businesses and park management will need to adapt** to increased summer heat, droughts, and more frequent fire- and weather-related park closures, which directly impact visitor comfort and revenues.  \n- These shifts underscore an urgent need to anticipate **changing travel patterns, increased operating costs, and the need for climate adaptation investments**.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Summer temperatures will rise by 1–2°C and reach 26–30°C (July–September) by 2040 | July: 26.05°C, August: 29.96°C, September: 30.42°C | Climsight model projections (2040–2049) |\n| 2 | Significant reduction in summer precipitation, with August dropping to just 2.22 mm/month | August precipitation: 2.22 mm/month by 2040s | Climsight data (2040–2049) |\n| 3 | Increased frequency and intensity of wildfires and extreme heat events | U.S. parks face more disasters; 90% of counties hit by climate events; rising summer temperatures | Wikipedia (summarizing peer-reviewed and government reports) |\n| 4 | Park visitation patterns shifting due to uncomfortable and unsafe summer conditions | Heatwaves and wildfires prompt park closures/disruptions | Wikipedia, regional park reports |\n| 5 | Higher temperatures and drier summers threaten tourism business profitability and visitor satisfaction | Higher operational and management costs; declines in comfort | Wikipedia, climate assessments |\n| 6 | ECOCROP database shows no direct ecological analogues for tourism in this region | N/A | ECOCROP search results |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Climate data are based on model simulations and projections from reputable meteorological research (nextGEMS project, as provided).\n- Wikipedia references are synthesizations of peer-reviewed studies and U.S. government assessments, ensuring expert-reviewed credibility.\n- Where direct crop/ecosystem analogues for \"tourism\" are missing, this is explicitly stated (“N/A”).\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile projections from global and regional climate models provide robust trends (warming, drying summers, increased wildfire/activity risk), uncertainties remain regarding the precise magnitude and year-to-year variability of changes by 2040. Visitor behavior, pace and type of park adaptation measures, and future policy interventions could alter some outcomes. Additionally, the inherent unpredictability of natural hazards and the complex ways tourists respond to new risks (shifting visiting seasons, altered travel choices) add to the uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Proactively upgrade park infrastructure (including evacuation protocols, wildfire defenses, cooling/shelter amenities, and communication systems) to handle increased heat, wildfire risk, and extreme weather disruptions.\n2. Shift marketing and operational focus to promote tourism during shoulder (spring/fall) seasons when conditions are milder, and plan for possible reductions in peak summer visitation.\n\n---",
