  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving climate patterns affect the development of wind and solar power in India over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nEvolving climate patterns in India will generally increase climate-related risks to both wind and solar power, with rising temperatures reducing solar efficiency and shifting monsoon and wind patterns affecting resource predictability and infrastructure resilience.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nIndia is projected to experience warmer temperatures, more variable rainfall, and shifts in wind patterns over the next 30 years. Rising average and extreme temperatures, especially during May–June (expected to reach 38–40°C), will lower photovoltaic efficiency and increase cooling needs for solar systems. Monsoon rainfall will remain intense but both rainfall and wind parameters show interannual and seasonal variability, raising the risk of disruptions from extreme events (e.g., heavy rain, storms). While wind speeds may slightly increase in midsummer, increased variability and higher risks of weather extremes will challenge planning and grid reliability for renewables. Both sectors must adapt to evolving resource patterns and extreme conditions for sustainable growth.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | May–June temperatures rising from 37–39°C (2020s) to 38–40°C (2040s) | Monthly mean values of temperature (2020–2049) | ClimSight dataset | numeric |\n| 2 | Monsoon precipitation shows high interannual variability, with peaks in July–September | Monthly mean precipitation: July–September 2020s (115–305 mm), projected to fluctuate in 2030s and 2040s | ClimSight dataset | numeric |\n| 3 | Seasonal wind (u_wind) speeds increase in July (up to 4.39 m/s in 2040s) with moderate interseasonal changes | Monthly mean u_wind data 2020–2049 | ClimSight dataset | numeric |\n| 4 | Wikipedia supports that rising temperature and extreme rainfall can lower solar yield and elevate operational risks | Summary of Wikipedia 'Climate change impact on wind and solar power in India' | Wikipedia url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change | citation |\n| 5 | Increased climate extremes heighten renewable energy vulnerability | Cited impacts of heatwaves, storms, and monsoon variability | Wikipedia url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on current emissions and mid-range model projections for 2020–2049; actual future trends may vary if mitigation intensifies.  \n- Data limitations: Regional/local climate projections may differ from grid-point means; fine-scale wind and irradiation data not directly evaluated.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in temperature and monsoon trend direction; moderate confidence in wind projections and local operational risks.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Site new wind and solar projects with robust climate risk screening—especially considering flood risk and heat stress.  \n2. Invest in adaptive technologies (e.g., heat-tolerant solar panels, resilient grid design) and long-term monitoring of wind and solar resource variability.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “u_wind/v_wind” refer to east-west and north-south wind speed components (m/s), key for wind resource assessment.  \n- “Photovoltaic efficiency” means how well solar panels convert sunlight to electricity—efficiency drops as temperature rises.  \n",
