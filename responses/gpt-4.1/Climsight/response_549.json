  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will the health impacts of climate change differ between urban and rural populations in India by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2040, urban Indians will face escalated risks of heat-related illness and pollution-driven disease, while rural populations will remain more vulnerable to malnutrition, waterborne disease, and livelihood loss from climate-driven agricultural disruption.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate change will result in nuanced, location-dependent health impacts across India by 2040. Urban centers like New Delhi will experience intensified heatwaves—summer mean temperatures surpassing 40°C—compounded by air pollution, increasing heatstroke and cardiorespiratory illness, especially as the urban heat island effect amplifies extremes. Urban density and infrastructure shortcomings heighten these risks. In contrast, rural populations, dependent on agriculture (over 56% of the population), will see health risks tied to erratic rainfall and rising temperatures, leading to greater food insecurity, poor nutrition, and increased exposure to water- and vector-borne illnesses. Infrastructure and access to healthcare will mediate these risks, leading to distinctive challenges and adaptation needs for both groups.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                            | Evidence supporting the statement                                                                         | Source                                         | Type           |\n|---|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| 1 | Urban heat-related risks rise sharply                | July mean 40.96°C by 2040s in New Delhi, past city high 48°C, urban heat island exacerbates heat extremes | Climate model data / Wikipedia: Climate change in India | numeric/citation|\n| 2 | Rural populations’ food and health vulnerabilities   | Over 56% of India’s population works in agriculture; rainfall patterns more erratic 2020–2040              | Climate data / Wikipedia: Climate change in India | numeric/citation|\n| 3 | Urban air pollution adds to heat-related mortality   | Cities’ poor air quality worsens health outcomes during extreme heat events                                | Wikipedia: Climate change in India             | citation       |\n| 4 | Water/vector-borne diseases grow in rural areas      | Rising temperature and erratic rain foster mosquito and water-borne disease threats                        | Wikipedia: Climate change in India             | citation       |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on 2040 regional climate model trends and extension from national projections; assumes continued urbanization and current patterns of urban/rural infrastructure\n- Data limitations: Projected health-specific outcomes for 2040 not directly quantified; urban/rural boundaries and migration trends may shift\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in climate and livelihood risk trends; moderate confidence in precise health burden distribution by 2040\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Strengthen urban heat early-warning and response systems, invest in cool infrastructure and public health services in cities.\n2. Boost rural adaptive capacity via improved water management, diversified cropping, and expanded health surveillance for infectious diseases.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Urban heat island: Cities become hotter than less built-up areas due to concrete and lack of greenery.\n- Vector-borne diseases: Illnesses (like dengue or malaria) transmitted by insects that reproduce more as climate warms.",
