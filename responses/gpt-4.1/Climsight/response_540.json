  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat are the anticipated public health consequences of climate change in the Bay of Bengal region over the next 30 years?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, and more extreme weather will increase heat-related illnesses, exacerbate vector-borne diseases, malnutrition, and risks from floods in the Bay of Bengal region.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nOver the next 30 years, the Bay of Bengal region around Kolkata is expected to face worsening public health impacts due to climate change. Projected increases in extreme heat (up to 36°C in some summer months), more variable and at times intense rainfall (with monthly precipitation sometimes exceeding 400 mm), and recurrent storm or flood risks will amplify heat stress and infectious diseases. Vulnerable populations will also experience greater exposure to waterborne and vector-borne diseases, food insecurity due to crop disruption, malnutrition, and challenges with water quality (notably arsenic contamination), especially in densely populated and low-lying areas. Targeted public health responses and climate-resilient infrastructure are key to reducing these escalating risks.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Extreme heat events will increase heat-related illnesses | Projected monthly mean temperature rises to 36.16°C (July, 2040-49) | Dataset: Climate data 2040-49, see data above | numeric |\n| 2 | Floods, storms and rainfall extremes heighten waterborne and vector-borne disease risk | Precipitation peaks (>400 mm/month in September 2040-49) during monsoon elevate standing water, enabling outbreaks | Dataset: Precipitation data, 2040-49 | numeric |\n| 3 | Dense population and arsenic-contaminated water increase vulnerability | Estimated 10.4 million exposed to groundwater arsenic in West Bengal | Wikipedia: West Bengal environment | citation |\n| 4 | Variable monsoons threaten crop yields and food security, increasing malnutrition risk | Heavy rainfall and flooding linked to agricultural disruption | Wikipedia, climate datasets | text |\n| 5 | Region prone to severe natural hazards – floods and storms recur | Documented flood/storm events in 1986, 2002, 2009, 2017, 2018 | Natural hazards table above | numeric/text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis based on 2020–2049 climate data; assumes current emission and adaptation trends persist  \n- Data limitations: No downscaled district-level health projections; health impact estimates inferred from climate and hazard data patterns  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in increased heat/flood risk and associated illness surges; moderate confidence around exact disease/malnutrition trends and adaptation response effectiveness\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Strengthen heat early warning systems, public health outreach, and medical capacity to manage heatwaves and flood emergencies.  \n2. Invest in vector control, safe water initiatives (addressing arsenic and flood contamination), and climate-resilient food programs to reduce infectious disease and malnutrition.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Vector-borne diseases” are illnesses spread by insects like mosquitoes (e.g., malaria, dengue).  \n- “Monsoon” refers to the season with intense rain (June–October locally), linked to floods and disease outbreaks.  \n- “Arsenic poisoning” is long-term health damage from contaminated drinking water, affecting many West Bengal residents.",
