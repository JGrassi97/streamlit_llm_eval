  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n How might climate variability impact sovereign credit risk for nations heavily dependent on agriculture in Central America by 2040?. \n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate variability by 2040 is projected to heighten sovereign credit risk for Central American nations dependent on agriculture, due to hotter temperatures and increased seasonal drought leading to reduced crop yields and fiscal stress.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, climate simulations for Guatemala City—a representative locale in Central America—indicate mean summer temperatures rising to 37°C, regularly surpassing the 28°C optimal maximum for staple crops like maize, with frequent periods of markedly low precipitation outside peak rainy months. These conditions are well outside optimal crop growth ranges (17–28°C, 800–1250 mm annual precipitation). As agricultural output declines from heat and drought stress, government revenues fall, worsening fiscal balances and amplifying difficulties in meeting sovereign debt obligations. The result is an elevated likelihood of sovereign credit downgrades and costlier international borrowing for these economies, especially without swift adaptation in agricultural and fiscal management.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Summer temperatures will reach up to 37°C—well above optimal for staple crops | 2040-2049 mean: June 37.22°C, July 37.10°C; crop optimal max: 28°C | Climate data, ECOCROP | numeric |\n| 2 | Most months receive low precipitation, far less than optimal crop needs | Jan–May, Nov, Dec <5 mm/month; crop optimal 800–1250 mm/year | Climate data, ECOCROP | numeric |\n| 3 | Crop yields are threatened, implying reduced export/fiscal revenue | Climate and ECOCROP data: local heat/drought coincide with below-optimal crop conditions | Climate, ECOCROP | numeric/text |\n| 4 | No explicit financial data retrieved linking climate to sovereign risk, mechanism inferred | N/A | Wikipedia/CDS/financial search (no results) | N/A |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis based on downscaled model data for Guatemala City, extrapolated to broader agricultural regions; actual impacts may vary with local adaptation and global market changes.\n- Data limitations: Direct sovereign credit risk data for the region were not retrieved; inferences are from biophysical/economic linkages.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in projected climate stress; moderate confidence in causal chain to sovereign risk due to missing regional fiscal datasets.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Governments should prioritize investment in drought-tolerant crops, improved irrigation, and agricultural diversification to buffer fiscal revenue against climate volatility.\n2. International financiers and rating agencies should incorporate climate risk into sovereign credit assessments for agricultural Central America and incentivize adaptive practices.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Sovereign credit risk”: The chance that a national government cannot pay off its debts.\n- “Crop optimal range”: The climate (temperature, rainfall) where crops grow best and produce the highest yields; outside this range, production suffers.",
