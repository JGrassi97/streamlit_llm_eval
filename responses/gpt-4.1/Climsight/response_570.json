  "QuestionText": "How will a reduction in the number of months with average temperatures below freezing affect the viability of the ski industry in the Pyrenees near Andorra by 2040?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2040, climate projections for the Pyrenees near Andorra indicate a significant reduction in the number of months with average temperatures below freezing. Where historically winters offered roughly five months suitable for dependable snow cover (November–April), the period with sub-zero monthly means will drop to just one or two months, with freezing temperatures now only likely in February and possibly March. This change will sharply reduce the length and reliability of the local ski season: natural snowfall will be far less predictable, and technical snowmaking will also become more challenging as it requires sustained cold ground and air. As a result, the economic viability of traditional ski operations will be severely threatened—necessitating adaptation by both ski resorts and local authorities.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- The drop to only 1–2 months with sub-freezing averages reduces the number of days natural snow can accumulate and remain, as well as the window for effective artificial snowmaking.\n- This directly impacts winter tourism, employment, and local revenue, creating a structural risk for communities currently dependent on skiing activities.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Freezing months decrease from ~5 to 1–2 by 2040 | Modelled monthly mean temps show only Feb (–0.65°C) and Mar (–1.33°C) below 0°C; all other months above freezing | NextGEMS simulations, 2040s |\n| 2 | Ski industry depends on sub-zero temps for snow making and natural cover | Mountain climate and ski tourism knowledge | Wikipedia: Mountain climate, Ski industry |\n| 3 | Shortened and unreliable season threatens ski sector's economic viability | Expert consensus; supported by regional climate research and economic studies | Wikipedia; consensus in mountain tourism literature |\n| 4 | Previous observations already show risk for Pyrenean resorts due to rising temps | Peer-reviewed and expert-reviewed studies | Wikipedia, scientific reviews |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Most data stems from high-resolution, model-based climate simulations and peer/expert-reviewed syntheses. Wikipedia summaries draw from these sources and the scientific literature.\n- The provided climate model data is recent and tailored to local conditions, representing a robust evidentiary basis.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nThe key uncertainty lies in the exact timing and intensity of temperature shifts for specific microclimates, as mountain weather is variable and local altitudinal effects can create cold pockets where snow may last longer. Yearly fluctuations, snowstorm frequency, and non-temperature-related factors (such as precipitation totals, wind, or extreme weather) also add variability. Nevertheless, the overarching trend of warming and shrinking cold months is highly robust across models and studies for this region. Whether technical solutions (such as advanced snowmaking) can partially offset these losses will depend on both tech progress and whether even the coldest periods consistently remain below freezing.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Local ski areas should invest in adapting to a far shorter and less predictable ski season, for example via next-generation snowmaking, shifting to higher-altitude or north-facing slopes, or pivoting to four-season tourism (wellness, culture, hiking, cycling, conferences) to maintain revenue.\n2. Regional policy-makers need to plan support for economic diversification, invest in retraining winter tourism workers, and reconsider major long-term investments in ski-only infrastructure.\n\n---",
