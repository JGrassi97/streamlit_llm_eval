  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n How will future climate scenarios influence investment risk in the tourism sector of the Caribbean islands by 2035?. \n\n Do not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2035, investment risk in Caribbean tourism will increase due to rising extreme heat, intensified storms and rainfall, and sea level rise, all threatening critical infrastructure and sector viability.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nClimate projections for Liberta, Antigua and Barbuda indicate higher mean and extreme monthly temperatures (summer highs up to ~38°C by 2040), intensified rainfall events during hurricane season (August–October), and continued strong winds, all of which raise the frequency and cost of climate-related damage to tourism infrastructure. Sea level rise further endangers coastal resorts and attractions. This convergence of hazards is likely to increase operational risks, insurance costs, and capital losses, potentially reducing the sector’s profitability and attractiveness for investment. Opportunities may persist for climate-resilient infrastructure and diversified tourism, but timely adaptation will be essential.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Rising summer temperatures and more intense heat extremes by 2035 | Projected July mean temp rises from 36.98°C (2020s) to 37.8°C (2030s), with maxes up to 38.65°C (2040s) | Climate dataset at 17.0608, -61.7964 | numeric |\n| 2 | Intensified seasonal rainfall, especially in peak hurricane months | Precipitation in September increases from 38.04mm (2020s) to 59.56mm (2030s) | Climate dataset | numeric |\n| 3 | Persistently strong winds and increased storm intensity raise damage risk | Monthly mean winds above 2 m/s (August–September), increasing negative u_wind and v_wind trends | Climate dataset | numeric |\n| 4 | Tourism infrastructure is mainly coastal and vulnerable to sea level rise and hurricanes | 29–32 million people in the region live <3m above sea level; growing hurricane/flooding costs (~11–17% GDP annually) | Wikipedia: Climate change in the Caribbean | citation |\n| 5 | Economic impact: tourism at ~25–35% of regional GDP, with damages from extreme events threatening this share | Estimated hurricane costs US$350–550 million/yr; future sea level rise projections up to 1-4 ft by 2050 | Wikipedia: Climate change in the Caribbean | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Analysis based on mean projections for decades 2020–2049; future extremes and variability may differ.  \n- Data limitations: Projections rely on regional models and historical analogs for hurricane/flood risk; does not include all socio-economic adaptive capacity.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in rising temperature and increased seasonal rainfall; moderate confidence in socioeconomic effects due to adaptation limits.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize investment in climate-resilient, elevated, and floodproof tourism infrastructure by 2030.  \n2. Integrate climate risk assessment into all large capital tourism projects, considering relocation from highly exposed coastal sites.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"u_wind\" and \"v_wind\" refer to east-west and north-south wind components; higher values indicate risk of stormy conditions.  \n- Precipitation measured in mm/month shows risk of intense rain and localized flooding.",
