  "QuestionText": "How will future climate scenarios influence investment risk in the tourism sector of the Caribbean islands by 2035?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2035, tourism investments in Liberta, Antigua and Barbuda, and the wider Caribbean face significantly elevated risks due to projected rises in both average and extreme temperatures, increased rainfall during critical months, and an ongoing threat of hurricanes and related extreme weather events. Peak monthly temperatures are expected to exceed 37°C, while precipitation surges in the core hurricane season (August–October) will likely heighten flood risk and weather-related disruptions. This will translate to higher costs for cooling, infrastructure resilience, insurance, and operational flexibility, as well as potential for shortened peak tourism seasons due to heat and storm events. These climate-driven pressures could also impact visitor comfort and, consequently, overall tourism demand.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- *Direct investment risk*: Higher likelihood of weather-related disruptions, damage, and costs for tourism infrastructure and operations.\n- *Strategic guidance*: Investors and planners must account for rising operational expenses, shifts in seasonal demand, and higher insurance premiums, influencing the viability and resilience of new tourism projects in the Caribbean by 2035.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Heatwaves and hurricanes will increasingly disrupt tourism sector operations in the Caribbean by 2035. | Hurricanes have historically caused financial losses and operational “blips” in the region’s tourism, with climate trends predicting increased extreme events. | Wikipedia: Tourism in the Caribbean |\n| 2 | Projected peak temperatures for the area will surpass 37°C in summer months by the 2030s. | July 2035: 37.8°C, August: 34.7°C (model averages) | Climate simulation data for Liberta, 2030–2039 |\n| 3 | Precipitation intensity will spike during late summer and early fall, in line with hurricane season. | September 2035: 59.56 mm/month, August: 32.27 mm/month | Same climate data |\n| 4 | Storm-related risks will remain high, amplifying insurance, infrastructure, and business interruption costs. | History of storms: 1998–1999, plus expert general statements linking climate change to more intense hurricanes. | Disaster data, Wikipedia |\n| 5 | Typical soil and species data do not influence tourism sector investment risk at this site. | Local soils (Cambisols) and vegetation irrelevant, focus is on built and human environments. | Data tables, ECOCROP database |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Model-based projections provide quantitative, site-specific climate risk data.\n- Wikipedia and disaster records are expert-reviewed and reflect regional consensus, but not peer-reviewed; thus, results are robust but general, lacking finer economic sector breakdowns.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile the climate forecasts used are based on accepted atmospheric models and historical disaster records, there is inherent variability in hurricane occurrence, storm tracks, and the magnitude of heatwaves or precipitation extremes. Factors such as local preparedness, evolving building codes, and emergency response capacity may mitigate or, conversely, exacerbate actual risks. Precise impacts on tourist arrival numbers or insurance cost increases are not modelled here, and future adaptation by the tourism sector may influence realized risks. Therefore, investment risk should be interpreted as a likely range influenced by both physical and human factors.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Incorporate climate-adaptive design into all new and renovated tourism infrastructure—this includes robust cooling (to address extreme heat), elevated structures, effective drainage, and hurricane-proof building standards.\n2. Secure comprehensive insurance policies, adjust business models for more flexible, potentially shorter peak seasons, and invest in real-time hazard monitoring and evacuation planning for guests and staff.\n\n---",
