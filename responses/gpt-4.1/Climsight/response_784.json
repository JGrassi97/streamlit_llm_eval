  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n What is the anticipated impact of wind speed changes on the insurance sector in Casablanca, Morocco by mid-century?.\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nWind speeds in Casablanca by mid-century are projected to change only slightly from present, implying minimal direct impact on insurance risk linked to wind-triggered claims.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy mid-century (2040-2049), projected monthly average wind speeds in Casablanca remain broadly similar to current values, with changes generally between -0.86 and +0.17 m/s. Consequently, wind-related insurance products—including parametric cover that triggers payouts based on wind speed thresholds—are unlikely to see significant changes in risk profiles for this location. There is no evidence of increasing wind hazard frequency or severity in the model data provided. As such, insurance rates, risk capital, and claim expectations driven directly by wind speed exposures are expected to remain stable, though ongoing monitoring is prudent, especially for rare and extreme gust events not covered by these models.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Wind speeds show minimal projected change by mid-century | Example: January wind speed mean shifts from 1.21 m/s (2020s) to 1.05 m/s (2040s), Δ = -0.16 m/s; most months’ Δ between -0.86 and +0.17 m/s | ClimSight Casablanca wind dataset | numeric |\n| 2 | Wind-triggered parametric insurance payout risks remain stable | CCRIF/parametric insurance products base payouts on wind speed, but thresholds would not be more frequently crossed with negligible wind speed changes | Wikipedia: CCRIF parametric insurance | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on mean monthly simulated wind, not peak gusts or localized storms.  \n- Data limitations: No direct data on gusts/extreme wind events; results reflect statistical means only.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence regarding mean wind behavior; low confidence about extremes.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Continue with current premium and risk models for wind-based insurance, as exposure patterns are stable.\n2. Regularly review updated forecasts/models for signals of increased frequency/intensity in gusts or rare wind events.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “u_wind” and “v_wind” refer to wind speeds along east-west and north-south axes, combined for total wind speed.\n- “Parametric insurance” pays automatically if a measurable condition (like wind speed) is met, not based on claims adjustment.\n\n",
