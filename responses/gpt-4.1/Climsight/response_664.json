  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will evolving temperature conditions affect the efficiency of geothermal plants in the East African Rift, Ethiopia by mid-century?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nProjected surface temperature increases of about 1°C by mid-century in the East African Rift will have a negligible direct impact on geothermal plant efficiency, with only minor risks to air-cooled systems during hotter months.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy the 2040s, mean monthly surface temperatures near Addis Ababa are expected to rise from 16–20°C to 17–21°C. Since geothermal energy systems in the East African Rift harness heat from deep underground, moderate changes in air temperature have little effect on the core energy conversion process. The main risk is a slight reduction in auxiliary (air-cooled condenser) efficiency during peak heat, most notably from May to July, possibly lowering net output very slightly. No substantial impact on geothermal reservoir productivity is anticipated. Adopting proactive cooling system management will help mitigate minor efficiency risks associated with hotter surface conditions.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Surface temperatures will rise by about 1°C (mean 2020s vs 2040s) | Jan–Jul rises from 16–20°C to 17–21°C; simulation deltas show +0.93–1.79°C for spring/summer | Provided climate simulation dataset | numeric |\n| 2 | Geothermal energy extraction relies on deep (crustal) heat flows, not surface air temps | East African Rift geothermal \"hot spots\" arise from tectonic activity and are linked to Earth's interior, not surface weather | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_Ethiopia | citation |\n| 3 | Air-cooled condenser efficiency may drop slightly under hotter air | Plant design literature and climate science consensus; observation that hotter ambient air reduces condenser cooling | RAG_search; literature consensus | citation/text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on a single climate modeling approach (no ensemble or scenario ranges specified)  \n- Data limitations: Does not include projections of specific temperature extremes or detailed plant technology models  \n- Confidence statements: High for minimal core geothermal impact; moderate for possible reduction in air-cooled systems during exceptional heat episodes\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize regular monitoring and maintenance of cooling and auxiliary systems, especially before and during the hottest months (May–July).  \n2. Evaluate the feasibility of upgrading air-cooled condensers or supplementing with water-cooled systems to reduce risk during periods of unusually high ambient temperatures.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Air-cooled condenser” refers to equipment using surrounding air to cool steam at power plants; higher air temperature reduces its effectiveness.  \n- “Geothermal resource” is the heat stored deep under the Earth’s surface and is unaffected by weather at ground level.\n\n",
