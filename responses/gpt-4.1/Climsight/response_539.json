  "QuestionText": "How will increased average temperatures affect the sustainability of salmon populations in the rivers of British Columbia, Canada, by mid-century?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy mid-century, average air temperatures in Area B (Halfmoon Bay), British Columbia, are projected to rise significantly during the crucial summer and early autumn months—reaching average monthly values of 19–20°C from July to September. This warming exceeds thresholds known to cause stress and increased mortality for salmon during migration and spawning. As a result, local salmon populations are likely to face heightened risks, including reduced migration success, lower survival rates, and diminished long-term sustainability.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Salmon are acutely vulnerable to elevated water temperatures above ~18–20°C, which can create thermal migration barriers and increase susceptibility to disease and mortality.  \n- Local projections show that by the 2040s, July–September air temperatures will regularly surpass these critical values, aligning with the timing of salmon runs and thus exacerbating stress during pivotal life stages.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | By the 2040s, July–September temperatures in Halfmoon Bay will reach ~19–20°C | Local climate simulation for 2040–2049 | Provided local climate data |\n| 2 | Salmon migration and survival are impaired when river temperatures exceed 18–20°C | Fisheries science summarized by Wikipedia and regional scientific reports | Wikipedia, BC fisheries/academic literature |\n| 3 | Increasing summer heat and prolonged warm periods are associated with salmon population declines in BC | Regional ecological assessments and peer-reviewed studies (reported in Wikipedia) | Wikipedia, regional research |\n| 4 | No relevant data for salmonids in ECOCROP database (tree species only) | Searched database found only “Eucalyptus salmonophloia” (not a fish) | ECOCROP database (\"N/A\") |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- The climate data are derived from downscaled simulations, regarded as high-quality, model-based projections.\n- Threshold information comes from established scientific literature on salmonid temperature physiology, well-documented in the field and reviewed by experts.\n- Supplemental information (Wikipedia, regional fisheries agencies) is consistent with peer-reviewed and government sources.\n- No crop-specific ECOCROP data for salmon (database result was for a tree species, not the fish).\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile the air temperature rise is well-supported by climate model projections, river water temperature outcomes will depend on local factors such as streamflow, riparian shading, groundwater influence, rainfall timing, and human land use. Air temperature is a reliable proxy for river warming, but precise effects on water temperature can vary, and local river geometry or cold-water refuges may buffer extreme temperatures in some years. The genetic diversity of local salmon stocks may also influence adaptive capacity, and projected impacts involve a range of possible outcomes—though the risk of reaching critical thresholds for salmon is nonetheless high given the climate data provided.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Establish a coordinated monitoring program for river water temperature and streamflow, especially during July–September, to identify periods when salmon are most at risk and to guide responsive management.  \n2. Support and expand riparian shading, wetland restoration, and water conservation measures in the watershed to mitigate peak river temperatures and assist salmon in adapting to a warmer climate.\n\n---",
