  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might temperature increases influence the maintenance needs of electrical grid networks in Tripoli, Libya throughout 2030-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures in Tripoli will increase electrical grid maintenance needs by elevating conductor resistance, line sag, outage risks, and equipment stress, especially during hotter months between July and September through 2030–2050.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nMonthly mean temperatures in Tripoli are projected to rise, with late summer (July–September) reaching 29–31°C by the 2040s. Increased heat will drive up conductor resistance and transmission losses, intensify line sag, and heighten the chance of outages and faults—potentially requiring more frequent inspections, rapid repairs, and adaptation strategies. Aging infrastructure and extended periods over 29°C will further stress grid components, amplifying the risk of equipment failure and fire hazards, especially in urban settings. Upgrading materials or implementing active monitoring will be critical for grid reliability and safety.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Temperatures in July–September projected to rise to 29–31°C by 2040s | Monthly mean values for 2040–2049 show August: 29.7°C, September: 31.03°C | Dataset output | numeric |\n| 2 | Higher temperatures increase conductor resistance and sag, raising energy losses and outage risk | “Resistance in power lines increases with temperature, which increases loss… High temperatures can cause conductors to sag, potentially reducing clearances and increasing the risk of outages or faults.” | Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission) | citation |\n| 3 | Heat-induced sag elevates fire and outage risks in urban grids | “Lines are vulnerable to wildfires when sag increases at high ambient temperatures and conductors contact dry vegetation.” | Wikipedia | citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: N/A  \n- Data limitations: Model projections available for monthly means, not for extremes or daily maximums.  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence for increased maintenance needs and risks due to well-established temperature impacts on grid infrastructure.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Implement distributed temperature sensing and remote monitoring for early detection of conductor overheating and sag.  \n2. Upgrade to advanced conductor materials designed for higher-temperature tolerance and reduced sag.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Conductor resistance: How much the wires in the grid resist electricity flow; higher with heat, causing energy loss.\n- Line sag: The drooping of overhead wires, which worsens in hot weather and can cause power faults or fires.",
