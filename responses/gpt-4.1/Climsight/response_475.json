  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat is the expected impact of changing monsoon wind patterns on the site selection for new onshore wind farms in western India by 2035?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nMonsoon wind shifts by 2035 are projected to moderately alter seasonal wind speeds and directions, so wind farm site selection in western India must emphasize locations with consistently strong summer winds and adaptability to interannual variability.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nAt latitude 23.3134, longitude 74.2179 in western India (Banswara, Rajasthan), modelled climate data indicate the seasonal monsoon remains a dominant driver of wind speeds through 2035, with southwest summer winds averaging 4–5 m/s and weaker winter winds below 1 m/s. Simulations show minimal net change in summer wind speeds and directions by 2030–2039 relative to 2020–2029 (e.g., July increases <0.03 m/s), though intra- and interannual fluctuations and monsoon onset uncertainty may rise due to climate change. Thus, optimal wind farm sites should focus on maximizing exposure to strong monsoonal flows while ensuring operational flexibility to accommodate the likely persistence of high seasonal variability in wind regimes.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Wind speeds in summer (June–September) are substantially higher than in non-monsoon months at the target site | For July 2020–2029: 5.02 m/s; for July 2030–2039: 5.05 m/s; for January 2030–2039: 0.35 m/s | nextGEMS pre-final simulations 2020s & 2030s | numeric |\n| 2 | Changes in monsoon wind speeds and directions by 2035 are modest and do not disrupt the prime wind season | July wind speed: +0.03 m/s; main wind direction remains ~237–238° (SW); variation <1° | nextGEMS pre-final simulations (2030 vs. 2020) | numeric |\n| 3 | Climate change may cause increased variability in the onset, timing, and intensity of monsoon winds | \"Monsoon precipitation is not uniformly distributed from year to year.\" | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon | text |\n| 4 | Monsoon winds are highly seasonal and vital for India's wind energy | \"The monsoon refers to seasonally reversing winds, with a rainy phase and a dry phase.\" | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: nextGEMS 2030–2039 projections compared to 2020–2029; no downscaled 2035 scenario, so analysis interpolates between available decade means.\n- Data limitations: Wind resource changes are based on decadal means, not high-frequency or extreme-value statistics; interannual variability not fully captured.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in persistence of strong monsoon winds as the primary seasonal wind resource; moderate confidence regarding minor net changes (<0.1 m/s); low confidence in prediction of extremes or year-to-year monsoon shifts by 2035.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Select sites with maximum exposure to prevailing SW monsoon winds (June–September) as primary resource, verified with multi-year wind measurement campaigns.\n2. Integrate flexibility into operational planning to accommodate annual and sub-seasonal monsoon timing variability, and periodically update resource assessments using latest model and observational data.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- Monsoon: A large-scale seasonal wind system causing a distinct wet (summer) and dry (winter) season in South Asia.\n- Wind speed (m/s): Measure of how fast the air moves; critical for wind turbine energy production—higher speeds mean more electricity.\n",
