  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat implications do rising temperatures have on risk assessments for the agricultural insurance sector in Fez, Morocco by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreasing temperatures in Fez by 2040 are projected to regularly exceed critical crop thresholds, heightening heat and drought risks, which will significantly raise agricultural insurance claims and necessitate new risk assessment models.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nBy 2040, Fez’s peak summer temperatures are expected to reach or surpass 32°C (August: 32.87°C; September: 32.54°C), exceeding the absolute maximum tolerance for important forage crops like Medicago arabica (32°C). Such chronic heat stress will threaten crop yields, raising the frequency and severity of insurance claims for harvest losses. Annual precipitation is also projected to decline in key months, intensifying drought risk. Insurers will need to revise premiums, risk models, and product structures to reflect greater climate volatility, including potentially higher loss ratios. There is significant opportunity for the insurance sector to promote climate-resilient agriculture through tailored products and risk-reduction incentives, but overall risk and volatility for the insurance portfolio will rise.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | August & September 2040 mean temperatures in Fez projected at/above 32°C | August: 32.87°C, September: 32.54°C | nextGEMS/ClimSight simulation, 2040s, Fez | numeric |\n| 2 | Medicago arabica max. temperature: 32°C | “absolute maximum temperature (°C): 32.0” | ECOCROP database output | numeric |\n| 3 | Insurance risk increases as temperatures regularly breach crop thresholds | “Temperature extremes lead to increased…reduced yields” | IPCC AR6, Wikipedia Climate Change | citation |\n| 4 | Crop insurance claims rise with intensifying drought and heat waves | “Warming causes more intense droughts…agricultural productivity” | Wikipedia – Climate Change, IPCC AR6 | citation |\n| 5 | Monthly precipitation decreases in peak agriculture months | e.g., May: -5.0 mm/month, March: -8.86 mm/month (2040s–2020s) | Climatological parameter delta, model data | numeric |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Projections based on nextGEMS climate models and assume moderate-to-high emissions, no large-scale adaptation.\n- Data limitations: Does not incorporate specific crop rotation or future technology adoption by 2040; actual farmer practices could change.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in projected temperature rise; medium confidence in direct insurance loss impacts due to adaptive capacity uncertainties.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Update insurance underwriting to explicitly model temperature exposure and adjust coverage terms for crops with thresholds below projected maxima.\n2. Incentivize or require adoption of heat- and drought-tolerant crop varieties, and support climate adaptation through premium discounts or risk-sharing schemes.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Heat stress” means plants are damaged by high temperatures, leading to lower yields or failure.\n- A “threshold” is the upper limit of temperature a crop can tolerate before losses occur; “insurance claims” are payouts to farmers when crops fail.",
