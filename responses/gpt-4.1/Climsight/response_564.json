  "QuestionText": "How will the attractiveness of the Mediterranean coast as a summer tourist destination be affected by climate change up to 2050?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2050, the attractiveness of the Mediterranean coast near Marseille as a summer tourist destination is likely to be affected by higher summer temperatures—approaching or exceeding 27–28°C in July and August—and persistently low rainfall during these peak months. The intensification of summer heat and increased frequency of extreme events such as marine heatwaves and wildfires will pose climbing risks to visitor comfort and safety. These climatic trends are expected to make the traditional summer peak less appealing, especially to heat-sensitive tourists or families with children, while boosting the appeal of the shoulder (spring and autumn) seasons, which will become milder and more comfortable. The coastal sector will also increasingly contend with risks from sea-level rise and periodic flooding, although the most acute effects of these will extend beyond 2050.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Connects projected local changes (hotter, drier, more hazardous summers) to tourism experience and demand.\n- Provides evidence for businesses, policymakers, and local planners to anticipate changing visitor behavior and infrastructure needs, ensuring long-term viability of coastal tourism.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | By 2040s, average July–August temperature at Marseille projected at 27–28°C | Climate simulation (2040–2049): 27.29°C (August), 23.88°C (July) | Climate dataset for Marseille |\n| 2 | July–August precipitation projected below 7 mm/month | Climate simulation (2040–2049): 6.63 mm (July), 2.63 mm (August) | Climate dataset for Marseille |\n| 3 | Intensified marine heatwaves and extreme temperatures expected | “Marine heatwaves… more frequent, more intense, more prolonged… than ever seen on record” | Wikipedia: Mediterranean Sea (referencing peer-reviewed sources) |\n| 4 | Increasing wildfire and coastal hazard risk | “Forest fires are most frequent cause for EU Solidarity Fund requests…”; sea-level rise projections | Wikipedia: Mediterranean Sea, EU/academic reports |\n| 5 | Potential for more attractive shoulder seasons (spring, autumn) | Mild conditions in projections, less heat discomfort | Climate dataset & synthesis |\n| 6 | Sea-level rise of up to 61 cm by 2100 may increase long-term flood risk | Regional hazard projections, IPCC estimates | Wikipedia: Mediterranean Sea, IPCC cited |\n| 7 | No natural disaster records for Marseille for recent years | Local hazard table: Empty for 2020–2050 | Provided hazard data |\n| 8 | ECOCROP shows no relevant precision data for tourism plant adaptation | N/A (irrelevant plant data returned) | ECOCROP |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- Sources include regional climate model projections, peer-reviewed regional hazard assessments, EU and IPCC summary reports, and referenced Wikipedia summaries.\n- Tourist experience impacts inferred logically from climate and hazard trends, which are robust and model-based.\n- Visitor behavioral shifts are less directly evidenced but are a standard adaptive response recognized by research.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nProjected climatic changes (hotter, drier, and sometimes more volatile summers) for the Marseille area are consistent across models and considered robust. However, considerable uncertainty remains around how tourists will respond: adaptation strategies (e.g., increased cooling in accommodations, shifting holiday periods), evolving preferences, and how much the sector will invest in climate resilience. Further, the frequency and direct impact of wildfires or marine heatwaves in any given year can fluctuate. Sea-level rise and coastal flooding risks are highly dependent on global emissions and adaptation measures; their biggest impacts likely stretch beyond 2050 but may begin to affect planning, insurance, and coastal maintenance within this period. The attractiveness of shoulder seasons will depend on market communication and existing infrastructure readiness.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Diversify the peak tourism offer by investing in amenities and marketing for spring and autumn travel—positioning these as premium, comfortable alternatives to increasingly hot peak summer months.\n2. Upgrade and adapt local infrastructure and safety systems: heatwave early warnings, fire prevention/response capacity, shaded and ventilated public spaces, and protection of waterfront areas from flooding and erosion.\n\n---",
