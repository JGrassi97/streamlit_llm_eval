  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n What are the broad financial risks posed by climate change to the real estate market in South Florida, USA, over the next 30 years?. \n\n Do not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nClimate change will dramatically increase financial risks to South Florida real estate through escalating flood, hurricane, insurance, and heat-related costs and property value impacts over the next 30 years.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nSouth Florida’s real estate market faces significant financial risks from climate change, mainly via more frequent and severe flooding, rising sea levels, and stronger hurricanes. These physical hazards drive up insurance premiums (already three times the U.S. average) and threaten property values, especially in low-lying coastal zones. Population growth in at-risk areas amplifies exposure. Model data for Miami project continued very high temperatures (monthly means up to 41°C), and hurricane-force winds will remain a major threat. Flood risk, outdated infrastructure, and insurance market volatility challenge asset values and mortgage viability. Over 6.5 million homes are at risk, and potential losses from a major hurricane could exceed $100-175 billion in South Florida.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Flood and hurricane risks drive high potential property loss | 6.5 million homes at risk, $100–175B in potential flood/hurricane loss (Miami/Tampa) | Wikipedia search, dataset | numeric/text |\n| 2 | Insurance premiums are escalating due to risk | Florida average home insurance: $4,231/year (2022), $6,000/year (2023), 3x U.S. avg. | Wikipedia search | numeric |\n| 3 | Extreme temperature and wind risks are rising | Monthly mean temperatures projected up to 41°C, persistent hurricane-force wind risk | Dataset/local climate data | numeric/text |\n| 4 | Population growth increases exposure in hazard zones | Miami metro +660,000 (2010-2020); 3/4 Florida pop. in coastal counties | Wikipedia search | numeric |\n| 5 | Flood risk, outdated FEMA maps affect property values | Flood/sea level rise risk inadequately assessed; insurance and mortgages at risk | Wikipedia search | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on recent decadal projections and observed insurance losses; assumes continued current climate trends.\n- Data limitations: Exact future hurricane frequency/intensity, pace of sea level rise, insurance market structure changes, and monthly precipitation details are uncertain.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction of risk (increasing); specific timing/magnitude of losses less certain.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Prioritize updated flood and hazard mapping to guide development and investment decisions.  \n2. Encourage resilience upgrades (elevated structures, improved drainage, building standards) and consider incentives to relocate from highest-risk areas.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Premium” means the annual cost owners pay for insurance.  \n- “Storm surge” refers to the rise in seawater level during hurricanes, increasing flood risk.",
