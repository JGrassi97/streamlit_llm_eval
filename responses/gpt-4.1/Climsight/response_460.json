  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow will changing climate patterns affect the potential for renewable energy generation across the Iberian Peninsula by 2040?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nBy 2040, climate change will likely reduce hydropower potential while enhancing solar prospects, with wind energy potential experiencing modest, largely stable changes across the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nThe Iberian Peninsula’s renewable energy mix will be reshaped by 2040 due to climate-driven shifts. Mean monthly temperatures in Madrid are projected to rise 1–2°C, while summer precipitation will fall sharply (e.g., August drops from 9 mm to 3 mm). This favors solar power through longer, sunnier, and hotter periods but threatens hydropower reliability due to dwindling water resources and reservoir stress. Wind energy generation is expected to remain relatively stable, showing only modest monthly variations in wind speed. The most significant opportunity is to expand solar infrastructure, while the largest risk lies in decreased hydropower output and increased unpredictability of water availability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                                | Evidence/Number/Citation                                                | Source             | Type          | \n|---|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| 1 | Temperatures will rise by ~1−2°C by 2040                 | July average up from 20.73°C (2020s) to 22.63°C (2040s)                 | ClimSight dataset  | numeric       |\n| 2 | Summer precipitation will decrease significantly         | August mean drops from 9 mm (2020s) to 3 mm (2040s)                     | ClimSight dataset  | numeric       |\n| 3 | Wind speeds will see only moderate change                | E.g., July winds: 0.65 m/s (2020s), 0.74 m/s (2040s)                    | ClimSight dataset  | numeric       |\n| 4 | Solar potential increases with hotter, drier conditions  | Temperature and precipitation trends; increased sunny days               | ClimSight dataset, Wikipedia | numeric/text  |\n| 5 | Hydropower faces strong risk due to lower water supply   | Summer rainfall decline jeopardizes reservoir levels                     | ClimSight dataset  | text          |\n| 6 | Wind is a significant component of Spain’s energy mix    | Wind currently ~12% of Spain’s electricity supply                       | Wikipedia          | citation      |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assessment based on changes modeled for Madrid, with central trends likely to represent broad regional changes but not all microclimates.\n- Data limitations: No direct values for solar irradiance; wind and precipitation data are monthly averages, limiting detail; local hydro facility variability not captured.\n- Confidence statements: High for temperature/precipitation trends, moderate for solar implications, medium for wind implications (limited year-to-year wind variability observable).\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Accelerate solar PV and thermal deployment to capitalize on increased sunshine and rising temperatures.\n2. Adapt hydropower operation and planning for increased droughts, including investment in water-saving technologies and diversification toward wind or hybrid solar/wind systems.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “u_wind/v_wind”: These terms denote two components of wind speed (east–west and north–south), combined they determine full wind speed and direction.\n- “ClimSight dataset”: This is a set of regional climate projections, with values representing monthly means for the Madrid area.\n\n",
