  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow might future temperature conditions influence the stability of financial markets in Nouakchott, Mauritania over the coming decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures in Nouakchott over the coming decades are projected to increase economic and operational risks that could destabilize local financial markets, primarily through impacts on productivity, health, and infrastructure.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nFuture temperature conditions in Nouakchott are expected to steadily increase, with summer monthly means rising from 36–37.5°C in the 2020s to nearly 39°C in the 2040s. Persistent extreme heat will heighten economic risks by reducing workforce productivity, raising health and cooling costs, and stressing infrastructure, which in turn may elevate insurance claims, affect loan performance, and challenge operational continuity for businesses. These compounding risks create significant uncertainties for financial market stability and may reduce attractiveness for investment. Proactive adaptation and risk management by financial actors will be critical to ensuring stability.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Monthly summer mean temperatures are projected to rise from 36–37.5°C (2020s) to ~39°C (2040s). | Monthly mean values of Temperature, °C for Nouakchott (2020–2049) | Dataset output | numeric |\n| 2 | Extreme heat can disrupt productivity, raise health costs, and affect financial instruments. | Literature on economic and sectoral impacts of extreme heat (no tool-detected citation available) | N/A | text |\n| 3 | Financial market stability may decrease where climate stress increases operational, credit, and insurance risks. | General agreement in climate-finance risk reports; specific supporting dataset not located in result | N/A | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Only one temperature projection set is referenced; specific scenario assumptions are not detailed.  \n- Data limitations: Direct, localized financial market datasets and sector-specific risk linkages are not available in tool returns.  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in temperature trends, moderate to low confidence in quantifying economic/financial impact.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Financial institutions and regulators should integrate extreme heat scenarios into risk models and stress tests.  \n2. Encourage investment in heat-resilient infrastructure and employee health adaptations to reduce systemic risks.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"Monthly mean temperatures\" refers to the average temperature measured each month.  \n- \"Operational, credit, and insurance risks\" are types of risk affecting companies, loans, and insurers that may arise from economic disruptions caused by heat.",
