  "QuestionText": "What is the potential financial impact of increased summer temperatures on the operating costs (e.g., cooling) for data centers located near Dublin, Ireland, over the next 20 years?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nOver the next 20 years, data centers in the Dublin region can expect a modest but noticeable increase in operating costs linked to cooling, due to gradually rising summer temperatures. Climate projections show that the average temperature in August is set to increase from around 16.6°C in the 2020s to about 17.5°C by the 2040s, with similar slight increases for June (from 10.9°C to 11.0°C) and July (from 14.3°C to 14.9°C). While these changes are not dramatic, even small rises in ambient temperature lead to higher cooling energy usage, directly impacting the running costs of energy-intensive facilities like data centers. Thus, organizations should anticipate increases in summer cooling expenditure, especially given the current trend of data center expansion around Dublin.\n\n**Key relevance points:**  \n- Even an increase of less than 1°C in average summer temperatures can materially raise the energy demands and costs for cooling data centers.\n- Early planning for energy efficiency and infrastructure upgrades can help manage and mitigate these increased costs, ensuring operational continuity and financial predictability amid gradual climate change.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table:**  \n\n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Summer temperatures will rise gradually in Dublin to 2049 | August mean temperature climbs from 16.6°C (2020s) to 17.5°C (2040s); similar trends in other summer months | ClimSight climate datasets, nextGEMS simulations |\n| 2 | Data center cooling needs and costs rise with ambient temperature | Operational experience, supported by IPCC and industry reports; physical relationship between outside temperature and cooling load | IPCC AR6, Wikipedia (Climate Sensitivity) |\n| 3 | Little change in summer precipitation or wind speed to offset cooling needs | Precipitation and wind changes are minor and inconsistent during summer months 2020–2049 | ClimSight, nextGEMS datasets |\n| 4 | Warming trend is robust in regional and global climate science | IPCC assessments confirm ongoing temperature increases for Ireland and Western Europe | IPCC AR6 |\n\n**Source quality:**  \n- Datasets are based on peer- and expert-reviewed climate models (nextGEMS).\n- IPCC reports and climate science literature (widely accepted, model-based) support the temperature/cooling relationship.\n- Industry consensus and operational precedent (referenced in the energy and IT literature).\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile the projected warming in summer months is robust and supported by high-quality climate modeling, the precise scale of financial impact on data center operations has uncertainty. This stems from possible variability in future energy prices, advances in cooling technology, regulatory shifts (such as future energy efficiency mandates), and the unpredictable nature of extreme weather events. Additionally, the effect size is relatively small (typically less than 1°C per decade in summer months), so financial impacts, while real, are likely to be incremental rather than transformative. Nonetheless, planning for gradual cost increases remains prudent, especially given the sensitivity of data center operations to ambient temperature spikes.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations:**  \n1. Assess current and projected data center cooling costs under warming scenarios (including up to 1°C increase in summer averages by 2049) to inform budgeting and risk management.\n2. Prioritize or accelerate upgrades to high-efficiency cooling systems—such as liquid cooling or advanced heat exchangers—as well as integration of real-time monitoring and dynamic controls for optimized energy use in a warmer climate.\n\n---",
