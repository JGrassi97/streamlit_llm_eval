  "ResponseText": "### Question  \n What is the potential financial impact of increased summer temperatures on the operating costs (e.g., cooling) for data centers located near Dublin, Ireland, over the next 20 years?. \n\n Do not make up any information or data in providing the answer. Do not cite articles or data unless you can explicitly access them and add them to your context.\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nIncreased summer temperatures near Dublin are projected to raise cooling-related operating costs for data centers by elevating energy demand, with July and August temperatures showing modest rises (~0.25–0.9°C) over the next 20 years.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nProjected summer temperatures (June-August) in Dublin are expected to increase slightly over the next two decades, with July rising from 14.28°C to up to 14.85°C, and August rising from 16.56°C to as high as 17.5°C. Since cooling can account for 10%–45% of data center energy use, these temperature increases will directly push up energy consumption for cooling, increasing operational costs. Although the temperature rise is moderate, any increase will proportionally raise cooling requirements. Dublin's relatively cool climate mitigates extreme impacts, but energy and cost increases remain a concern as data centers scale and climate trends continue.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement                                                                                                  | Evidence supporting the statement                                                                                    | Source                                                      | Type             | \n|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| 1 | Summer temperatures in Dublin projected to increase by up to 0.94°C over two decades (July, August months) | 2020–2029 July: 14.28°C, 2040–2049 July: 14.85°C; 2020–2029 August: 16.56°C, 2040–2049 August: 17.5°C               | ClimSight climate data (retrieved for Dublin coordinates)    | Numeric          |\n| 2 | Data center cooling is 10%–45% of total energy use and is sensitive to temperature increases               | Wikipedia: “Cooling energy in data centers varies from 10%...up to 45% of standard air-cooled data centers”          | Wikipedia (Data center cooling requirements)                | Citation         |\n| 3 | Increased temperatures raise operational costs for cooling                                                 | Cooling requirements rise as outside temperature increases, raising costs                                             | Wikipedia/Data center literature                            | Text             |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Based on mean temperature projections for three decades; assumes current energy/cooling technology persists  \n- Data limitations: No detailed cost modeling (e.g., € per °C increase); energy price changes and system improvements could affect impact  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction of effect, moderate in magnitude due to modest warming and technology variables\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Evaluate and upgrade data center cooling systems for higher energy efficiency to mitigate future cost increases.  \n2. Consider adopting new cooling technologies (e.g., liquid cooling, free-air cooling) to maintain resilience as mean temperatures rise.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Cooling load” refers to the total energy required to keep equipment from overheating.\n- Temperature values are monthly averages for summer months.",
