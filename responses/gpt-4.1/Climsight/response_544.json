  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nWhat public health challenges will arise from climate change in the densely populated river deltas of Southeast Asia over the next two decades?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nRising temperatures, extreme rainfall, sea level rise, and flooding will increase risks of infectious diseases, malnutrition, water and food insecurity, and climate-driven displacement, significantly impacting public health in Southeast Asian river deltas.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nIn the next two decades, communities in Southeast Asia’s river deltas—like Cần Thơ in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta—will face growing public health threats due to climate change. Increasing average monthly temperatures (up to 31.2°C by 2040–2049) and more intense, erratic rainfall (up to nearly 400 mm/month) will drive a rise in vector- and water-borne diseases such as dengue and diarrheal illnesses, cause more severe heat stress, and threaten crop yields through both flooding and salinity intrusion from sea level rise. These impacts will disrupt food security, increase malnutrition, and intensify the risk of mass displacement, challenging already strained health and infrastructure systems in the region’s densely populated, low-elevation communities.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Mean temperatures will rise, increasing heat stress and disease risk | Monthly averages projected to 30.5–31.2 °C (April–May) by 2040–2049 | Retrieved climate simulation data | Numeric |\n| 2 | Precipitation becomes more erratic, enhancing flood and disease risk | Modelled rainfall peaks at ~393 mm/mo by June 2040–2049, with year-to-year variability | Retrieved climate simulation data | Numeric |\n| 3 | Salinity intrusion and land loss reduce food/water security | \"A one-metre rise in sea level will cover several km² of rice paddies in Vietnam,\" leading to malnutrition and salinity in water supplies | Wikipedia: Effects of climate change on agriculture | Citation |\n| 4 | Dense populations face greater malnutrition/displacement risk | \"Delta populations are high and heavily dependent on agriculture, undernourishment rising in Southeast Asia\" | Wikipedia: Effects of climate change on agriculture | Citation |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes medium- to high-emission scenario pathways; actual outcomes may vary with mitigation/adaptation  \n- Data limitations: Climate projections are regional and averaged; disease/health impact estimates are qualitative, not quantitative  \n- Confidence statements: High confidence in direction and principal risks; moderate uncertainty on timing, magnitude, and local adaptive capacity\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Expand disease surveillance, early warning systems, and flood management infrastructure tailored to delta regions  \n2. Invest in resilient water/sanitation services and promote climate-adaptive, salt-tolerant agriculture to safeguard health and food security\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Vector-borne diseases” refers to illnesses transmitted by animals (often mosquitoes), including dengue and malaria  \n- “Salinity intrusion” means saltwater moving into rivers, soils, and water supplies, harming crops and drinking water quality",
