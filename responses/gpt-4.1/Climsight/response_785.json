  "QuestionText": "How could evolving wind patterns affect financial risk planning in Oujda, Morocco during 2020-2050?",
  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow could evolving wind patterns affect financial risk planning in Oujda, Morocco during 2020-2050?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nEvolving wind patterns in Oujda between 2020-2050 show modest monthly variability but no strong trend, implying moderate risk changes for financial planning, primarily in wind energy returns and insurance.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nWind data for Oujda from 2020-2050 indicate variable but generally stable monthly wind speeds, with no evidence of major intensification or direction change. Because wind resource reliability underpins returns on local wind energy investments and affects insurance exposure to storm risk, stable wind patterns reduce the likelihood of significant new risks or opportunities. However, month-to-month fluctuations and rare extremes—especially during summer–autumn—could still challenge insurers and energy revenue projections. Financial risk planning should focus on short-term wind variability and rare high-wind events rather than dramatic long-term shifts.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Monthly mean u_wind and v_wind show modest variation, no major changes over three decades | u_wind (Jan: 1.22→1.19→1.24 m/s; Jun: -0.02→0.51→0.26 m/s); v_wind (Jun: -1.24→-1.43→-1.22 m/s) | ClimSight dataset for Oujda, 2020–2049 | numeric |\n| 2 | Morocco’s wind resource is stable/favorable overall | “Average wind speed is 5.3 m/s over more than 90% of Morocco’s territory” | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Morocco | citation |\n| 3 | No clear evidence of intensifying wind extremes for Oujda | No data found supporting large changes in wind risk | dataset and tool search | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: No specific climate scenario (e.g., RCP) provided  \n- Data limitations: Lack of high-resolution or event-based extremes; focus on mean monthly trends  \n- Confidence statements: Moderate confidence in aggregate risk stability, but low for rare local wind extremes\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Monitor for updates on extreme wind event frequency and integrate into insurance risk models.  \n2. Use scenario stress-testing for wind power investments to account for possible short-term variability.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- \"u_wind\" and \"v_wind\" are technical terms for the east-west and north-south components of wind speed.  \n- \"Mean monthly wind values\" refer to average speeds per month, which help estimate windiness and storm risk.",
