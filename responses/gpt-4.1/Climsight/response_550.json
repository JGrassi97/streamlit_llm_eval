  "ResponseText": "### Question  \nHow is the geographic range for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector for dengue fever, expected to change in southern Europe due to rising average winter temperatures by 2035, for example near Rome, Italy?\n\n### Short answer (1-line)  \nWinter warming near Rome is likely to enable a northward and year-round expansion of Aedes aegypti’s range by 2035, raising establishment risk in southern Europe.\n\n### Executive summary (≤ 120 words)  \nMild winter temperatures projected for Rome through the 2030s (with mean January ~7.9°C and December ~11.9°C) are close to or above thresholds that allow Aedes aegypti to overwinter. The mosquito’s ability to exploit refugia and persist through winter, combined with ongoing temperature increases, means its establishment risk in southern Europe—including urban areas like Rome—will rise. This could lead to more persistent mosquito populations and increased local risk of dengue and related diseases if not adequately managed.\n\n### Evidence & sources *(supports credibility)*  \n| # | Statement | Evidence supporting the statement | Source | Type | \n|---|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Mean winter temperatures in Rome are rising toward mosquito survival thresholds | Projections: Jan mean temp ~7.9°C (2040s); Dec ~11.9°C (2030s) | Retrieved climate data for Rome | numeric |\n| 2 | Aedes aegypti is expanding into temperate regions aided by milder winters | “Aedes aegypti has spread to tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions throughout the world… As the world's climate becomes warmer, the range will spread north and south.” | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_aegypti | citation |\n| 3 | Overwintering and persistence facilitated by underground refugia and eggs’ resilience | “Some mosquito species survive in restrictive environments by taking advantage of underground refugia. Eggs can remain viable for over a year in a dry state, allowing re-emergence after a cold winter…” | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_aegypti | citation |\n| 4 | Direct link between winter temperatures and vector establishment risk | “Impact of winter temperature rise on Aedes aegypti distribution…” (Internal Knowledge: Summary) | Internal RAG search | text |\n\n### Key uncertainties & assumptions  \n- Scenario / model range: Assumes current warming trends continue (based on projections for 2030–2049).\n- Data limitations: Lack of local, long-term entomological field data specific to overwintering in Rome.\n- Confidence statements: High confidence in climate projections; moderate confidence in precise timing/intensity of mosquito establishment.\n\n### Recommendations *(supports actionability)*  \n1. Increase winter vector surveillance and targeted mosquito control interventions in urban areas of southern Europe, especially Rome.\n2. Develop public health campaigns to reduce standing water and improve community awareness of dengue vector risks as climate warms.\n\n### Accessibility notes  \n- “Overwintering” means the ability of a species to survive through the winter season.\n- “Refugia” refers to microhabitats that provide shelter from harsh weather, allowing survival.",
