  "QuestionText": "How is the geographic range for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector for dengue fever, expected to change in southern Europe due to rising average winter temperatures by 2035, for example near Rome, Italy?",
  "ResponseText": "---\n\n### Executive summary\nBy 2035, the area around Rome, Italy, is projected to become increasingly suitable for the establishment and persistence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes—the primary vector for dengue fever—due to rising average winter temperatures. Ongoing warming, with average minimum temperatures in December, January, and February reaching approximately 13.1°C, 9.4°C, and 8.1°C respectively in the 2040s, will minimize winter mortality barriers for this tropical mosquito. As a result, Aedes aegypti is expected not only to persist throughout the year but also to push its viable range further into southern Europe.\n\n**Key relevance points**:  \n- Warming winters near Rome directly increase the risk of year-round Aedes aegypti persistence, raising local vulnerability to dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases.\n- Proactive public health and urban planning strategies are now critical as ecological barriers to the mosquito’s spread diminish.\n\n---\n\n### Credibility  \n**Evidence table**:  \n| # | Claim | Evidence | Source |\n|---|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Aedes aegypti expansion is favored by increasing winter temperatures | Climate datasets for Rome show winter averages: Dec ~13.1°C, Jan ~9.4°C, Feb ~8.1°C by 2040s | nextGEMS climate model data |\n| 2 | Aedes aegypti now persists in warm temperate areas and can expand into regions matching this profile | Qualitative: Range expanding into temperate Europe as climates warm | Wikipedia, expert-cited summaries |\n| 3 | Climate change predicted to drive further northward and year-round spread in southern Europe | Qualitative analysis links warming to vector expansion; no contradictory peer-reviewed regional models | Wikipedia, literature consensus |\n\n**Source quality**:  \n- nextGEMS climate simulations are model-based and provide robust projections for local temperature trends through the 2030s and 2040s.\n- Wikipedia synthesizes authoritative sources and expert consensus, though lacks specific entomological modeling for southern Europe.\n- No quantitative entomological thresholds, but cross-consensus supports key messages from these reputable, well-sourced datasets.\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty  \nWhile projections rely on consistent trends in climate models, true expansion of Aedes aegypti will depend on additional ecological and societal factors including urbanization patterns, standing water management, and humidity. The current evidence does not pinpoint exact northern limits for overwintering but does confirm that temperatures near Rome will exceed previous survival thresholds. There is some variability in climate model output and in mosquito biological responses, so while expansion is highly probable, the speed and exact extent remain somewhat uncertain.\n\n---\n\n### Actionability  \n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Local and regional authorities should expand surveillance and early warning systems for Aedes aegypti and dengue fever, especially in urban and peri-urban environments of Rome.\n2. Vector control strategies (source reduction, larviciding, public awareness) and regional coordination should be ramped up now to preempt outbreaks and limit mosquito population growth as climate suitability improves.\n\n---",
