st.title("AI for Climate Adaptation â€“ Evaluation Platform")

st.markdown("""
This platform is part of a **research project on the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs)** in supporting climate change adaptation.

The objective is to systematically evaluate how different AI systems perform in generating responses to climate-related questions, with a focus on four key dimensions:

- **Relevance** â€“ How well the response addresses the given question
- **Credibility** â€“ Scientific accuracy and plausibility
- **Uncertainty communication** â€“ Clarity in expressing limitations or confidence levels
- **Actionability** â€“ Usefulness of the response for decision-making or planning

---

### ðŸ§ª Methodology

Participants are presented with pairs of responses generated by different AI systems and asked to evaluate them according to the criteria above.

The responses are anonymized to ensure unbiased comparison across models.
